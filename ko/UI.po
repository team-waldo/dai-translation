"\n"
"IV.    What Is Non-Personal Information and When Does EA Collect It?\n"

"\n"
"A.    What Types of Non-Personal Information Does EA Collect?\n"
"\n"
"When you use EA online and mobile products and services or you play our "
"games on your PC or game system, we may collect certain non-personally "
"identifiable information for purposes including improving our products and "
"services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the "
"provision of software updates, dynamically served content and product "
"support as well as communicating with you. The non-personal information "
"collected may include demographic information including gender, age, zip "
"code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game "
"system, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device "
"identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media "
"Access Control (MAC) address and connection. We also collect other non-"
"personal information such as username, user ID or persona, feature usage, "
"game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings, time spent "
"playing our games, and click paths as well as other data that you may "
"provide in surveys, via your account preferences and online profiles such as "
"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local "
"shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’"
"s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"Some EA websites and services use Google Analytics, a web analytic service "
"offered by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “Cookies”, text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "
"of this website. The information about your usage of websites, collected "
"through these cookies, will be transmitted to and stored on Google server "
"based in the US.  On behalf of EA, Google will use this information in order "
"to evaluate your usage of this websites, to make reports on website "
"activities and/or to provide the website operator with other services "
"related to this websites. Your IP-address collected by Google Analytics will "
"not be matched up with other data of Google. You may prevent the "
"installation of cookies by adjusting your browser settings.  Please note "
"that if you disable cookies, it is possible that you may not use all "
"functionalities of EA’s websites. You may also prevent the cookies from "
"collecting and storing your information by downloading and installing the "
"following browser-plugin under the following link http://tools.google.com/"
"dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.\n"
"\n"
"A non-exclusive list of the other analytics companies that operate their own "
"technologies on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services "
"can be found at privacyappendix.ea.com. \n"
"\n"
"5.    Ad Serving Technology \n"
"\n"
"EA’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "

"6.    Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"
"\n"
"At login to EA online products and/or services, during the setup of an "
"Origin Account, and/or at the point of sale, EA may collect data about your "
"device in order  to create a hash of machine components.  Information "
"collected for this purpose shall not be stored in retrievable form.  EA uses "
"the collected information for the prevention of fraud, and for "
"authentication purposes. EA may consolidate the machine hash created for "
"this purpose with your Origin Account; data consolidated this way will not "
"be shared with any other third party, and will be used exclusively for "
"security, fraud prevention and authentication purposes by EA.\n"
"\n"
" V.    Information Provided To EA By Third Parties.\n"
"\n"
"EA also obtains personal and non-personal information from third parties as "
"discussed below.  EA only uses this data for purposes consistent with this "
"policy.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Xbox Live\n"
"\n"
"If you sign up to play EA games through Microsoft's Xbox Live Service, "
"Microsoft will provide your Xbox Live user account information to EA so that "
"we can establish an Origin Account for you. You need an Origin Account to "
"play EA's Xbox Live titles. By signing up to play EA's Xbox Live titles, you "
"agree that Microsoft can transfer your user account information to EA. "
"Information transferred from Microsoft to EA includes your Gamertag, email "
"address, state or province, country, language and age but does not include "
"credit card number or other financial account information.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Other Information Collected From Third Parties\n"
"\n"
"EA may also receive other information from third parties, including in "
"connection with the operation and distribution of our products and services "
"as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal "
"and anonymous information collected or provided directly by you. Some third "
"party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with "
"information from your accounts there with your permission. \n"
"\n"
"By playing an EA game through a social network or other third party platform "
"or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or "
"service via one of our products and/or services, you are authorizing EA to "
"collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all "
"information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform "
"could provide to EA through the social network/third party platform "
"Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third "
"party social network or platform. Your agreement takes place when you "
"connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products "
"and/or services, and/or when you connect with, “accept” or “allow” (or "
"similar terms) one of our applications through a social network, or other "
"third party platform or service.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also collect or receive information about you from other EA users who "
"choose to upload their email and other contacts.  This information will be "
"stored by us and used primarily to help you and your friends connect.\n"
"\n"

"and demographic studies and/or other data that we use to supplement personal "
"information provided directly by you.\n"
"\n"
"VI.    What Happens To The Information EA Collects?\n"
"\n"
"A.    How EA Uses Your Information\n"
"\n"
"EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders "
"and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. "
"In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you "
"messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, "
"special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You "
"may also later opt out of such communications sent via email.\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually "
"and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our "
"products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our "
"customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for "
"authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper "
"functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In "
"addition, we combine non-personal information with personal information, "
"such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent "
"customer service, administering loyalty programs, and tailoring our "
"communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.  \n"
"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"
"Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also "
"conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public "
"display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) "
"generated through your participation.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Will EA Share My Information With Third Parties?\n"
"\n"
"EA will never share your personally identifiable information with third "
"parties without your consent.   We may, however, share non-personally "
"identifiable, aggregated and/or public information with third parties.  "
"There may be circumstances where you may share information on your own.  "
"Please see section XI for more details about your rights to information you "
"share publicly on EA including user generated content, forums, blogs, and "
"profiles. You may also opt in to allow EA to share your personal information "
"with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we "
"believe may be of interest to you. To opt out of further communications from "
"a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, "
"please contact that partner or sponsor directly.\n"
"\n"
"EA does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years "
"of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share "
"or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, "
"provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the "
"unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of EA customer information may be "
"transferred to its successor or assign regardless of age.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal "
"information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or "
"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"
"When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access "
"any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, "
"EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. "
"These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for "
"any other purpose without your specific consent.\n"
"\n"
"You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any "
"third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an "
"informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that "
"party.\n"
"\n"
"We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal "
"communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products "
"and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply "
"with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when "
"we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address "
"potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, "
"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "
"post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public "
"information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI "
"for more details.\n"
"\n"
"VII.    Where Is The Information Held?\n"
"\n"
"EA is a global organization and the majority of the computer systems on "
"which EA collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives "
"are based in the United States and The Netherlands. We may also utilize data "
"storage facilities located in Asia, Canada and/or the European Union. Your "
"personal information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by EA in "

"\n"
"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "
"service, or we will either block such users from providing personal "
"information, or will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the "
"collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At "
"that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child "
"may make publically available, how we will user the information and other "
"practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide "
"more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or "
"mobile products and services, this may include such general audience "
"communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and "
"your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal "
"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "
"the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's "
"personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an "
"email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 "
"Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  "
"Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy "
"Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"

"use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has "
"previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to "
"obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with "
"strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child "
"should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about "
"using the Internet safely.\n"
"\n"
"Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy "
"policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child’s "
"information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.\n"
"\n"
"Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an "
"activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal "
"information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On "
"certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless "
"of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, "
"Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of "
"contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online "
"chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in "
"similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that "

"be accessed or recorded by EA employees, and there is no expectation of "
"privacy or confidentiality there.  \n"

"in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by "
"other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited "
"messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information "

"such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is "
"not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with "
"that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on "
"an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the "
"site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third "
"parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal "

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
" - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement ("
"including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
" - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action "
"litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
" The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "

"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
" - Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
" - Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "

"\n"
"A.    What Types of Non-Personal Information Does EA Collect?\n"
"\n"
"When you use EA online and mobile products and services or you play our "
"games on your PC or game system, we may collect certain non-personally "
"identifiable information for purposes including improving our products and "
"services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the "

"code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game "
"system, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device "

"game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings, time spent "
"playing our games, and click paths as well as other data that you may "
"provide in surveys, via your account preferences and online profiles such as "
"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local "
"shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’"
"s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"Some EA websites and services use Google Analytics, a web analytic service "
"offered by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “Cookies”, text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "
"of this website. The information about your usage of websites, collected "
"through these cookies, will be transmitted to and stored on Google server "

"\n"
"5.    Ad Serving Technology \n"
"\n"
"EA’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "
"result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help "
"track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technology enable "
"advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile "
"device and replaced while you are online.  We or third parties operating the "
"advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender "
"as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that "
"appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile "
"product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and "
"repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests "
"and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may "
"collect data for this purpose including IP address (including for purposes "
"of determining your approximate geographic location), device ID's, "
"information about your software, applications and hardware, browser "
"information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine "
"or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length "
"of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage "
"information, web pages and mobile internet sites which have been viewed by "

"advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The foregoing data may "
"be used and disclosed per this policy and the privacy policy of the company "
"providing the ad serving technology.   \n"
"\n"
"The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information "
"collected or obtained from EA with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of "
"websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their "
"own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"

"on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services can be found "

"not play. \n"
"\n"
"6.    Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"
"\n"
"At login to EA online products and/or services, during the setup of an "
"Origin Account, and/or at the point of sale, EA may collect data about your "
"device in order  to create a hash of machine components.  Information "
"collected for this purpose shall not be stored in retrievable form.  EA uses "
"the collected information for the prevention of fraud, and for "
"authentication purposes. EA may consolidate the machine hash created for "
"this purpose with your Origin Account; data consolidated this way will not "
"be shared with any other third party, and will be used exclusively for "
"security, fraud prevention and authentication purposes by EA.\n"
"\n"
" V.    Information Provided To EA By Third Parties.\n"

"as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal "
"and anonymous information collected or provided directly by you. Some third "
"party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with "
"information from your accounts there with your permission. \n"
"\n"
"By playing an EA game through a social network or other third party platform "
"or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or "
"service via one of our products and/or services, you are authorizing EA to "
"collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all "
"information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform "
"could provide to EA through the social network/third party platform "
"Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third "
"party social network or platform. Your agreement takes place when you "
"connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products "

"information provided directly by you.\n"
"\n"
"VI.    What Happens To The Information EA Collects?\n"
"\n"
"A.    How EA Uses Your Information\n"
"\n"
"EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders "
"and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. "
"In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you "
"messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, "
"special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You "
"may also later opt out of such communications sent via email.\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually "
"and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our "
"products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our "
"customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for "
"authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper "
"functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In "
"addition, we combine non-personal information with personal information, "
"such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent "
"customer service, administering loyalty programs, and tailoring our "
"communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.  \n"
"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"
"Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also "
"conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public "
"display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) "
"generated through your participation.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Will EA Share My Information With Third Parties?\n"
"\n"
"EA will never share your personally identifiable information with third "
"parties without your consent.   We may, however, share non-personally "
"identifiable, aggregated and/or public information with third parties.  "
"There may be circumstances where you may share information on your own.  "
"Please see section XI for more details about your rights to information you "
"share publicly on EA including user generated content, forums, blogs, and "
"profiles. You may also opt in to allow EA to share your personal information "
"with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we "
"believe may be of interest to you. To opt out of further communications from "
"a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, "
"please contact that partner or sponsor directly.\n"
"\n"
"EA does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years "
"of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share "
"or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, "
"provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the "
"unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of EA customer information may be "
"transferred to its successor or assign regardless of age.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal "
"information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or "
"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"
"When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access "
"any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, "
"EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. "
"These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for "
"any other purpose without your specific consent.\n"
"\n"
"You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any "
"third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an "
"informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that "
"party.\n"
"\n"

"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "

"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "

"practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide "
"more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or "

"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "
"the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's "
"personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an "
"email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 "

"Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"

"use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has "
"previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to "
"obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with "

"information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On "
"certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless "
"of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, "
"Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of "

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
" - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement ("
"including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
" - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action "
"litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
" The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
" - Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
" - Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "

"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"

"offered by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “Cookies”, text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "

"5.    Ad Serving Technology \n"
"\n"
"EA’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "
"result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help "

"appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile "
"product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and "

"collected or obtained from EA with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "

"websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their "
"own privacy policies. \n"

"not play. \n"
"\n"
"6.    Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"
"\n"
"At login to EA online products and/or services, during the setup of an "
"Origin Account, and/or at the point of sale, EA may collect data about your "
"device in order  to create a hash of machine components.  Information "
"collected for this purpose shall not be stored in retrievable form.  EA uses "
"the collected information for the prevention of fraud, and for "
"authentication purposes. EA may consolidate the machine hash created for "
"this purpose with your Origin Account; data consolidated this way will not "
"be shared with any other third party, and will be used exclusively for "
"security, fraud prevention and authentication purposes by EA.\n"
"\n"
" V.    Information Provided To EA By Third Parties.\n"
"\n"
"EA also obtains personal and non-personal information from third parties as "
"discussed below.  EA only uses this data for purposes consistent with this "

"\n"
"2.    Other Information Collected From Third Parties\n"

"as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal "
"and anonymous information collected or provided directly by you. Some third "
"party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with "
"information from your accounts there with your permission. \n"
"\n"
"By playing an EA game through a social network or other third party platform "
"or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or "
"service via one of our products and/or services, you are authorizing EA to "
"collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all "
"information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform "
"could provide to EA through the social network/third party platform "
"Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third "
"party social network or platform. Your agreement takes place when you "
"connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products "
"and/or services, and/or when you connect with, “accept” or “allow” (or "
"similar terms) one of our applications through a social network, or other "

"VI.    What Happens To The Information EA Collects?\n"
"\n"
"A.    How EA Uses Your Information\n"
"\n"
"EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders "
"and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. "
"In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you "
"messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, "
"special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You "
"may also later opt out of such communications sent via email.\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually "
"and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our "
"products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our "
"customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for "
"authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper "
"functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In "

"communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.  \n"
"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"

"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"

"communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products "
"and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply "

"we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address "
"potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, "
"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "
"post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public "
"information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI "

"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
" - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement ("
"including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
" - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action "
"litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
" The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
" - Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
" - Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"\n"
"A.    What Types of Non-Personal Information Does EA Collect?\n"
"\n"
"When you use EA online and mobile products and services or you play our "
"games on your PC or game system, we may collect certain non-personally "
"identifiable information for purposes including improving our products and "
"services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the "

"support as well as communicating with you. The non-personal information "

"code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game "
"system, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device "
"identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media "

"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local "
"shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’"
"s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"Some EA websites and services use Google Analytics, a web analytic service "
"offered by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “Cookies”, text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "
"of this website. The information about your usage of websites, collected "
"through these cookies, will be transmitted to and stored on Google server "
"based in the US.  On behalf of EA, Google will use this information in order "
"to evaluate your usage of this websites, to make reports on website "
"activities and/or to provide the website operator with other services "

"technologies on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services "
"can be found at privacyappendix.ea.com. \n"
"\n"
"5.    Ad Serving Technology \n"
"\n"
"EA’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "
"result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help "
"track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technology enable "
"advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile "
"device and replaced while you are online.  We or third parties operating the "
"advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender "
"as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that "
"appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile "
"product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and "
"repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests "
"and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may "
"collect data for this purpose including IP address (including for purposes "
"of determining your approximate geographic location), device ID's, "
"information about your software, applications and hardware, browser "
"information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine "
"or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length "
"of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage "
"information, web pages and mobile internet sites which have been viewed by "
"you (as well as date and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, "
"advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The foregoing data may "
"be used and disclosed per this policy and the privacy policy of the company "
"providing the ad serving technology.   \n"
"\n"
"The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information "
"collected or obtained from EA with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of "
"websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their "
"own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"A non-exclusive list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks "
"on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services can be found "
"at privacyappendix.ea.com. \n"

"that may collect information based on your interaction with ads on this "
"site, in our mobile products, and other sites or products not owned/managed "
"by EA, or to \"opt out\" of targeted advertising delivered by National "
"Advertising Initiative (NAI) member ad networks, you should visit www."
"networkadvertising.org.\n"
"\n"
"For more information about targeted advertising within our mobile products "
"or to opt-out, see the appendix to this policy at privacyappendix.ea.com.\n"
"\n"
"These ad serving technologies are integrated into our sites, online or "
"mobile products and services; if you do not want to use this technology, do "
"not play. \n"
"\n"
"6.    Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"
"\n"
"At login to EA online products and/or services, during the setup of an "
"Origin Account, and/or at the point of sale, EA may collect data about your "
"device in order  to create a hash of machine components.  Information "
"collected for this purpose shall not be stored in retrievable form.  EA uses "
"the collected information for the prevention of fraud, and for "
"authentication purposes. EA may consolidate the machine hash created for "
"this purpose with your Origin Account; data consolidated this way will not "
"be shared with any other third party, and will be used exclusively for "
"security, fraud prevention and authentication purposes by EA.\n"
"\n"
" V.    Information Provided To EA By Third Parties.\n"
"\n"
"EA also obtains personal and non-personal information from third parties as "
"discussed below.  EA only uses this data for purposes consistent with this "
"policy.\n"
"\n"
"1.    PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system\n"
"\n"
"If you sign up to play EA games through a PlayStation®4 computer "
"entertainment system, your Sony Entertainment Network account information "
"will be provided to EA so that we can establish an Origin Account for you. "
"You need an Origin Account to play EA’s titles online. By signing up to play "
"EA’s titles, you agree that limited user account information can be "
"transferred to EA. Information transferred to EA includes your name, email "
"address, online ID, country, language and date of birth but does not include "
"credit card number or other financial account information.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Other Information Collected From Third Parties\n"
"\n"
"EA may also receive other information from third parties, including in "
"connection with the operation and distribution of our products and services "
"as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal "
"and anonymous information collected or provided directly by you. Some third "
"party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with "
"information from your accounts there with your permission. \n"
"\n"

"or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or "

"information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform "
"could provide to EA through the social network/third party platform "
"Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third "
"party social network or platform. Your agreement takes place when you "
"connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products "
"and/or services, and/or when you connect with, “accept” or “allow” (or "
"similar terms) one of our applications through a social network, or other "
"third party platform or service.\n"

"information provided directly by you.\n"
"\n"
"VI.    What Happens To The Information EA Collects?\n"
"\n"
"A.    How EA Uses Your Information\n"
"\n"
"EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders "
"and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. "
"In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you "
"messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, "
"special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You "
"may also later opt out of such communications sent via email.\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually "
"and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our "
"products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our "
"customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for "
"authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper "
"functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In "
"addition, we combine non-personal information with personal information, "
"such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent "
"customer service, administering loyalty programs, and tailoring our "
"communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.  \n"
"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"
"Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also "
"conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public "
"display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) "
"generated through your participation.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Will EA Share My Information With Third Parties?\n"
"\n"
"EA will never share your personally identifiable information with third "
"parties without your consent.   We may, however, share non-personally "
"identifiable, aggregated and/or public information with third parties.  "
"There may be circumstances where you may share information on your own.  "
"Please see section XI for more details about your rights to information you "
"share publicly on EA including user generated content, forums, blogs, and "
"profiles. You may also opt in to allow EA to share your personal information "
"with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we "
"believe may be of interest to you. To opt out of further communications from "
"a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, "
"please contact that partner or sponsor directly.\n"
"\n"
"EA does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years "
"of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share "
"or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, "
"provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the "
"unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of EA customer information may be "
"transferred to its successor or assign regardless of age.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal "
"information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or "
"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"
"When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access "
"any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, "
"EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. "
"These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for "
"any other purpose without your specific consent.\n"
"\n"
"You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any "
"third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an "
"informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that "
"party.\n"
"\n"
"We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal "
"communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products "
"and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply "
"with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when "
"we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address "
"potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, "
"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "
"post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public "
"information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI "
"for more details.\n"
"\n"
"VII.    Where Is The Information Held?\n"
"\n"
"EA is a global organization and the majority of the computer systems on "
"which EA collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives "
"are based in the United States and The Netherlands. We may also utilize data "
"storage facilities located in Asia, Canada and/or the European Union. Your "
"personal information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by EA in "
"the United States and in other countries, including countries outside your "
"country of residence both in and outside the European Union and Asia, and "

"information and ensure the security of our systems. No method of "
"transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% "
"secure, however. We cannot assume responsibility or liability for "
"unauthorized access to our servers and systems.\n"
"\n"
"IX.    Review, Correction Of Your Information, Requesting Removal From "
"Mailing Lists And Deactivating Your Account\n"
"\n"

"our site and navigating to “My Account,” and viewing your “Basic Information”"

"requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and "
"operation of our websites.\n"
"\n"
"Some EA sites or services may collect personal information that is not "

"as a result of deleting your data associated with an application on "
"Facebook, you will no longer have access to that application.\n"
"\n"
"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "
"service, or we will either block such users from providing personal "
"information, or will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the "
"collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At "
"that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child "
"may make publically available, how we will user the information and other "
"practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide "
"more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or "
"mobile products and services, this may include such general audience "
"communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and "
"your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal "
"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "
"the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's "
"personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an "
"email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 "
"Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  "
"Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy "
"Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"
"\n"
"If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, "
"use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has "
"previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to "
"obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with "
"strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child "
"should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about "
"using the Internet safely.\n"
"\n"
"Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy "
"policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child’s "
"information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.\n"
"\n"
"Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an "
"activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal "
"information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On "
"certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless "
"of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, "
"Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of "
"contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online "
"chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in "
"similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that "
"you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted, public information, may "
"be accessed or recorded by EA employees, and there is no expectation of "
"privacy or confidentiality there.  \n"
"\n"
"You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit "
"in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by "
"other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited "
"messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information "
"you choose to make public in any of these forums.\n"

"information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as "

"images or photos that you choose to submit to EA’s site. Please see our "
"Terms of Service at terms.ea.com on this point and for other guidelines "

"\n"
"XII.    Third Party Sites.\n"
"\n"
"Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites "
"such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is "
"not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with "
"that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on "
"an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the "
"site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third "
"parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal "
"information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will "
"adhere to the same privacy and security practices as EA. We encourage you to "
"review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you "

"site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any "
"personal information.\n"

"\n"
"Under California law, California Residents who have an established business "
"relationship with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) or one of its subsidiaries may "

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
" - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement ("
"including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
" - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action "
"litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
" The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
" - Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
" - Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local "
"shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’"
"s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"Some EA websites and services use Google Analytics, a web analytic service "
"offered by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “Cookies”, text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "
"of this website. The information about your usage of websites, collected "
"through these cookies, will be transmitted to and stored on Google server "

"5.    Ad Serving Technology \n"
"\n"
"EA’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "
"result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help "
"track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technology enable "
"advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile "

"advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender "
"as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that "
"appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile "
"product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and "
"repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests "
"and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may "

"of determining your approximate geographic location), device ID's, "

"information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine "
"or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length "

"advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The foregoing data may "
"be used and disclosed per this policy and the privacy policy of the company "
"providing the ad serving technology.   \n"
"\n"
"The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information "
"collected or obtained from EA with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of "
"websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their "
"own privacy policies. \n"

"on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services can be found "

"not play. \n"
"\n"
"6.    Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"
"\n"
"At login to EA online products and/or services, during the setup of an "
"Origin Account, and/or at the point of sale, EA may collect data about your "
"device in order  to create a hash of machine components.  Information "
"collected for this purpose shall not be stored in retrievable form.  EA uses "

"authentication purposes. EA may consolidate the machine hash created for "
"this purpose with your Origin Account; data consolidated this way will not "
"be shared with any other third party, and will be used exclusively for "
"security, fraud prevention and authentication purposes by EA.\n"
"\n"

"or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or "

"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "

"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "

"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"

"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "

"not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with "
"that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on "

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"\n"
"IV.    What Is Non-Personal Information and When Does EA Collect It?\n"

"software usage (on PC, mobile and game system platforms).\n"

"We will retain your information for as long as your Origin Account is active "
"or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your Origin "
"Account or request that we no longer use your information contact the "
"Privacy Policy Administrator in your country listed on our site at "
"privacyadmin.ea.com, or if your country is not listed, by contacting the "

"where we are legally required to retain your information.\n"
"\n"
"A.    What Types of Non-Personal Information Does EA Collect?\n"
"\n"
"When you use EA online and mobile products and services or you play our "
"games on your PC or game system, we may collect certain non-personally "
"identifiable information for purposes including improving our products and "
"services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the "
"provision of software updates, dynamically served content and product "
"support as well as communicating with you. The non-personal information "
"collected may include demographic information including gender, age, zip "
"code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game "
"system, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device "
"identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media "
"Access Control (MAC) address and connection. We also collect other non-"
"personal information such as username, user ID or persona, feature usage, "
"game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings, time spent "
"playing our games, and click paths as well as other data that you may "
"provide in surveys, via your account preferences and online profiles such as "
"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local "
"shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’"
"s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "

"or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or "
"service via one of our products and/or services, you are authorizing EA to "

"\n"
"A.    How EA Uses Your Information\n"
"\n"
"EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders "
"and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. "
"In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you "
"messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, "
"special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You "
"may also later opt out of such communications sent via email.\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually "
"and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our "
"products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our "
"customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for "
"authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper "
"functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In "
"addition, we combine non-personal information with personal information, "
"such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent "
"customer service, administering loyalty programs, and tailoring our "
"communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.  \n"
"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal "
"information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or "
"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"

"We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal "
"communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products "
"and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply "
"with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when "
"we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address "
"potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, "
"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "
"post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public "
"information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI "
"for more details.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"EA is a global organization and the majority of the computer systems on "
"which EA collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives "
"are based in the United States and The Netherlands. We may also utilize data "
"storage facilities located in Asia, Canada and/or the European Union. Your "

"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "

"practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide "
"more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or "
"mobile products and services, this may include such general audience "
"communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and "

"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "
"the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's "
"personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an "
"email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 "

"obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"

"information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On "
"certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless "
"of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, "
"Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of "

"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"tax purposes, and will be used only for prize fulfillment.\n"
"\n"
"IV.    What Is Non-Personal Information and When Does EA Collect It?\n"
"\n"
"Non-personal information, alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. "
"EA collects non-personal information about your use of our online and mobile "
"products and services both on our website and in the course of game play and "
"software usage (on PC, mobile and game system platforms).\n"
"\n"
"We will retain your information for as long as your Origin Account is active "
"or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your Origin "
"Account or request that we no longer use your information contact the "
"Privacy Policy Administrator in your country listed on our site at "
"privacyadmin.ea.com, or if your country is not listed, by contacting the "

"where we are legally required to retain your information.\n"
"\n"
"A. What Types of Non-Personal Information Does EA Collect?\n"
"\n"
"When you use EA online and mobile products and services or you play our "
"games on your PC or game system, we may collect certain non-personally "
"identifiable information for purposes including improving our products and "
"services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the "
"provision of software updates, dynamically served content and product "
"support as well as communicating with you. The non-personal information "
"collected may include demographic information including gender, age, zip "
"code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game "
"system, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device "
"identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media "
"Access Control (MAC) address and connection. We also collect other non-"
"personal information such as username, user ID or persona, feature usage, "
"game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings, time spent "
"playing our games, and click paths as well as other data that you may "
"provide in surveys, via your account preferences and online profiles such as "
"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B. How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1. Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as \"local "
"shared objects,\" on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the "
"site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2. Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3. Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4. Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"Some EA websites and services use Google Analytics, a web analytic service "
"offered by Google Inc. (\"Google\"). Google Analytics uses \"Cookies\", text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "
"of this website. The information about your usage of websites, collected "
"through these cookies, will be transmitted to and stored on Google server "
"based in the US.  On behalf of EA, Google will use this information in order "
"to evaluate your usage of this websites, to make reports on website "
"activities and/or to provide the website operator with other services "
"related to this websites. Your IP-address collected by Google Analytics will "
"not be matched up with other data of Google. You may prevent the "
"installation of cookies by adjusting your browser settings.  Please note "
"that if you disable cookies, it is possible that you may not use all "
"functionalities of EA's websites. You may also prevent the cookies from "
"collecting and storing your information by downloading and installing the "
"following browser-plugin under the following link http://tools.google.com/"

"technologies on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services "
"can be found at privacyappendix.ea.com. \n"
"\n"
"5. Ad Serving Technology\n"
"\n"
"EA's websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "
"result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help "
"track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technology enable "
"advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile "
"device and replaced while you are online.  We or third parties operating the "
"advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender "
"as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that "
"appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile "
"product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and "
"repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests "
"and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may "
"collect data for this purpose including IP address (including for purposes "
"of determining your approximate geographic location), device ID's, "
"information about your software, applications and hardware, browser "
"information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine "
"or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length "
"of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage "
"information, web pages and mobile internet sites which have been viewed by "
"you (as well as date and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, "
"advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The foregoing data may "
"be used and disclosed per this policy and the privacy policy of the company "
"providing the ad serving technology.\n"
"\n"
"The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information "
"collected or obtained from EA with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of "
"websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their "
"own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"A non-exclusive list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks "
"on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services can be found "
"at privacyappendix.ea.com. \n"
"\n"

"that may collect information based on your interaction with ads on this "
"site, in our mobile products, and other sites or products not owned/managed "

"not play. \n"
"\n"
"6. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"
"\n"
"At login to EA online products and/or services, during the setup of an "
"Origin account, and/or at the point of sale, EA may collect data about your "
"device in order  to create a hash of machine components.  Information "
"collected for this purpose shall not be stored in retrievable form.  EA uses "
"the collected information for the prevention of fraud, and for "
"authentication purposes. EA may consolidate the machine hash created for "
"this purpose with your Origin account; data consolidated this way will not "
"be shared with any other third party, and will be used exclusively for "
"security, fraud prevention and authentication purposes by EA.\n"
"\n"

"as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal "
"and anonymous information collected or provided directly by you. Some third "
"party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with "
"information from your accounts there with your permission.\n"
"\n"
"By playing an EA game through a social network or other third party platform "

"such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent "
"customer service, administering loyalty programs and tailoring our "
"communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.\n"
"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends' list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends' list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services, and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"
"Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also "
"conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public "
"display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) "
"generated through your participation.\n"
"\n"
"B. Will EA Share My Information With Third Parties?\n"
"\n"
"EA will never share your personally identifiable information with third "
"parties without your consent.   We may, however, share non-personally "
"identifiable, aggregated and/or public information with third parties.  "
"There may be circumstances where you may share information on your own.  "
"Please see section XI for more details about your rights to information you "
"share publicly on EA including user generated content, forums, blogs, and "
"profiles. You may also opt in to allow EA to share your personal information "
"with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we "
"believe may be of interest to you. To opt out of further communications from "
"a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, "
"please contact that partner or sponsor directly.\n"
"\n"
"EA does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years "
"of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share "
"or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, "
"provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the "
"unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of EA customer information may be "
"transferred to its successor or assign regardless of age.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal "
"information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or "
"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"
"When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access "
"any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, "
"EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. "
"These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for "
"any other purpose without your specific consent.\n"
"\n"
"You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any "
"third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an "
"informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that "
"party.\n"
"\n"
"We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal "
"communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products "
"and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply "
"with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when "
"we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address "
"potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, "
"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "
"post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public "
"information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI "
"for more details.\n"
"\n"
"VII.    Where Is The Information Held?\n"
"\n"
"EA is a global organization and the majority of the computer systems on "
"which EA collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives "
"are based in the United States and The Netherlands. We may also utilize data "
"storage facilities located in Asia, Canada and/or the European Union. Your "
"personal information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by EA in "
"the United States and in other countries, including countries outside your "
"country of residence both in and outside the European Union and Asia, and "
"used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.\n"
"\n"
"VIII.    How Does EA Protect Your Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA understands the importance of keeping your information safe and secure. "
"EA will make commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personal "
"information and ensure the security of our systems. When you enter sensitive "
"financial information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we "
"encrypt the transmission of that information using commercially reasonable "
"methods. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of "
"electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. We cannot guarantee that your "
"information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach "
"of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We cannot "
"assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to our servers "
"and systems.\n"
"\n"
"IX.    Review, Correction Of Your Information, Requesting Removal From "
"Mailing Lists And Deactivating Your Account\n"
"\n"
"You can correct or update your account information at any time by logging on "
"our site and navigating to \"My Account,\" and viewing your \"Basic "
"Information\" or other account settings. Should you be unable to log in or "
"wish to have your account(s) deactivated, contact the Privacy Policy "
"Administrator in your country as listed on our site at privacyadmin.ea.com, "
"or if your country is not listed, by contacting the Privacy Policy "
"Administrator in the United States. We will be happy to review, update or "
"remove information as appropriate. We may still retain your information in "
"our files however, to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, and due "
"to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, "
"integrity and operation of our websites.\n"
"\n"
"Some EA sites or services may collect personal information that is not "
"accessible via our site. However, in such cases, you may be able to access "
"that information through alternative means of access described by the "
"service or by writing your local privacy policy administrator at "
"privacyadmin.ea.com and you will be contacted within 30 days regarding your "
"request.\n"
"\n"
"If you've granted EA access to your Facebook account information through an "
"EA or Playfish application, you may request that EA delete your Facebook "
"information by contacting the Privacy Policy Administrator listed at "
"privacyadmin.ea.com and specifying the Facebook application used.  Note that "
"as a result of deleting your data associated with an application on "
"Facebook, you will no longer have access to that application.\n"
"\n"
"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "
"service will either block such users from providing personal information, or "
"we will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and "
"sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will "
"provide a description of the information that the child may make publically "
"available, how we will use the information and other practices. We will not "
"knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than "
"is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA's online or "
"mobile products and services, this may include such general audience "
"communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and "
"your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal "
"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "
"the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's "
"personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an "
"email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 "
"Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  "
"Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy "
"Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"
"\n"
"If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, "
"use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has "
"previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to "
"obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with "
"strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child "
"should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about "
"using the Internet safely.\n"
"\n"
"Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy "
"policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child's "
"information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.\n"
"\n"
"Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an "
"activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal "
"information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On "
"certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless "
"of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, "
"Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of "
"contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online "
"chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user \"profiles\" for public view or in "
"similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that "
"you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted, public information, may "
"be accessed or recorded by EA employees, and there is no expectation of "
"privacy or confidentiality there.  \n"
"\n"
"You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit "
"in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by "
"other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited "
"messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information "
"you choose to make public in any of these forums.\n"
"\n"
"Note also that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain "
"information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as "
"advertising networks and analytics companies.  EA has no control over the "
"information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties "
"and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the "
"disclosure of information you would not like to share.\n"
"\n"
"If you post a video, image or photo on one of our sites for public view you "
"should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by "
"other users without your consent. We are not responsible for the videos, "
"images or photos that you choose to submit to EA's site. Please see our "
"Terms of Service at terms.ea.com on this point and for other guidelines "
"about posting content on our websites.\n"
"\n"
"XII.    Third Party Sites.\n"
"\n"
"Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites "
"such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is "
"not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with "
"that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on "
"an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the "
"site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third "
"parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal "
"information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will "
"adhere to the same privacy and security practices as EA. We encourage you to "
"review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you "
"request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an EA "
"site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any "
"personal information.\n"
"\n"
"XIII.    Products Offered In Partnership With Third Party(s)\n"
"\n"
"Members may register for other services from our site(s). Certain products "
"and/or services available on our site are provided to you in partnership "
"with third party(s) and may require you to disclose personally identifiable "
"information in order to register for and access such products and/or "
"services. Such products and/or services shall identify the third party "
"partners at the point of registration. If you elect to register for such "
"products and/or services your personally identifiable information will be "
"transferred to such third party(s) and will be subject to the privacy policy "
"and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy "
"practices and policies of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should "
"review the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) prior to "

"XV.    California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\n"
"\n"
"Under California law, California Residents who have an established business "
"relationship with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) or one of its subsidiaries may "
"choose to opt out of EA disclosure of personal information about them to "
"third parties for direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy "

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA's last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (\"Disputes\")"
", including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA's (or any of EA's licensors') intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (\"Notice of Dispute\").  "
"Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information "
"of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or "
"dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will "
"send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us)"
" or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B. Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C. Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to "
"the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted "
"by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis "
"or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or "
"authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative "
"capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA "
"AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS "
"INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED "
"CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree "
"otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, "
"and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class "
"proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then "
"the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D. Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will "
"take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents "
"outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of "
"San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA "
"agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to "
"compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, "
"modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E. Recovery and Attorneys' Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on "
"the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is "
"greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys' fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F. Limitation on Arbitrator's Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G. Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B. How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1. Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as \"local "
"shared objects,\" on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the "
"site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2. Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3. Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4. Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"Some EA websites and services use Google Analytics, a web analytic service "
"offered by Google Inc. (\"Google\"). Google Analytics uses \"Cookies\", text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "
"of this website. The information about your usage of websites, collected "
"through these cookies, will be transmitted to and stored on Google server "
"based in the US.  On behalf of EA, Google will use this information in order "
"to evaluate your usage of this websites, to make reports on website "
"activities and/or to provide the website operator with other services "

"5. Ad Serving Technology\n"
"\n"
"EA's websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "
"result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help "
"track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technology enable "
"advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile "
"device and replaced while you are online.  We or third parties operating the "
"advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender "
"as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that "
"appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile "
"product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and "
"repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests "
"and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may "
"collect data for this purpose including IP address (including for purposes "
"of determining your approximate geographic location), device ID's, "
"information about your software, applications and hardware, browser "
"information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine "
"or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length "

"advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The foregoing data may "
"be used and disclosed per this policy and the privacy policy of the company "
"providing the ad serving technology.\n"
"\n"
"The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information "
"collected or obtained from EA with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of "
"websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their "
"own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"A non-exclusive list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks "
"on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services can be found "

"6. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"

"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "

"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "
"service will either block such users from providing personal information, or "
"we will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and "
"sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will "
"provide a description of the information that the child may make publically "
"available, how we will use the information and other practices. We will not "
"knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than "
"is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA's online or "
"mobile products and services, this may include such general audience "
"communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and "
"your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal "
"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA's last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (\"Disputes\")"
", including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA's (or any of EA's licensors') intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (\"Notice of Dispute\").  "
"Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information "
"of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or "
"dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will "
"send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us)"
" or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B. Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C. Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to "
"the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted "
"by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis "
"or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or "
"authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative "
"capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA "
"AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS "
"INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED "
"CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree "
"otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, "
"and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class "
"proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then "
"the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D. Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will "
"take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents "
"outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of "
"San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA "
"agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to "
"compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, "
"modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E. Recovery and Attorneys' Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on "
"the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is "
"greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys' fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F. Limitation on Arbitrator's Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G. Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"\n"
"IV.    What Is Non-Personal Information and When Does EA Collect It?\n"

"software usage (on PC, mobile and game system platforms).\n"
"\n"
"We will retain your information for as long as your Origin Account is active "

"Account or request that we no longer use your information contact the "
"Privacy Policy Administrator in your country listed on our site at "

"Privacy Policy Administrator in the United States.   There may be instances "
"where we are legally required to retain your information.\n"
"\n"
"A.    What Types of Non-Personal Information Does EA Collect?\n"
"\n"
"When you use EA online and mobile products and services or you play our "
"games on your PC or game system, we may collect certain non-personally "
"identifiable information for purposes including improving our products and "
"services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the "
"provision of software updates, dynamically served content and product "
"support as well as communicating with you. The non-personal information "
"collected may include demographic information including gender, age, zip "
"code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game "
"system, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device "
"identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media "
"Access Control (MAC) address and connection. We also collect other non-"
"personal information such as username, user ID or persona, feature usage, "
"game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings, time spent "
"playing our games, and click paths as well as other data that you may "
"provide in surveys, via your account preferences and online profiles such as "
"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local "
"shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’"
"s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "

"A.    How EA Uses Your Information\n"
"\n"
"EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders "
"and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. "
"In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you "
"messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, "
"special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You "
"may also later opt out of such communications sent via email.\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually "
"and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our "
"products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our "
"customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for "
"authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper "

"such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent "
"customer service, administering loyalty programs, and tailoring our "

"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal "
"information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or "
"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"

"We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal "
"communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products "
"and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply "
"with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when "
"we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address "
"potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, "
"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "
"post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public "
"information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI "
"for more details.\n"

"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "

"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or "
"mobile products and services, this may include such general audience "
"communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and "

"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "
"the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's "
"personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an "
"email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 "

"obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"

"certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless "
"of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, "
"Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of "

"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"\n"
"A.    What Types of Non-Personal Information Does EA Collect?\n"
"\n"
"When you use EA online and mobile products and services or you play our "
"games on your PC or game system, we may collect certain non-personally "
"identifiable information for purposes including improving our products and "
"services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the "

"support as well as communicating with you. The non-personal information "

"code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game "
"system, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device "
"identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media "

"game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings, time spent "
"playing our games, and click paths as well as other data that you may "
"provide in surveys, via your account preferences and online profiles such as "
"friends lists or purchases, for instance. We may also receive information "
"from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or "
"other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly "
"by you.\n"
"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when "
"you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile "
"activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and "
"marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use "
"cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic "
"information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor "
"advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive "
"from the information collected other facts, such as determining the "
"applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements "
"within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. "
"Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for "
"purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This "
"information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you "
"don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to "
"deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game "
"usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, "
"how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. "
"Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads "
"contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad "
"companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers "
"are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You "
"can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being "
"sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do "
"so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies "
"on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more "
"information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com."
"\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local "
"shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies "
"are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’"
"s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal "
"cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One "
"method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your "
"preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www."
"macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality "
"of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your "
"game activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our "
"games or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and "
"those practices are subject to their own policies.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only "
"and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images "
"placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs "
"are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 "
"pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or "
"email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information "
"about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage "
"information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We "
"correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for "
"statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to "
"advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain "
"promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP "
"addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your "
"computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to "
"monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and "
"authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse "
"of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system "
"IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP "
"addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party "
"analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online "
"products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or "
"mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web "
"beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and "
"analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses ("
"including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), "
"mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser "
"types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), "
"referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, "
"information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or "
"applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and "
"types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising "
"conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, "
"other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and "
"time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game "
"is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase "
"history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile "
"unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and "
"in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine "
"the information collected with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your activities across their network of websites as "
"well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies "
"collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"
"Some EA websites and services use Google Analytics, a web analytic service "
"offered by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “Cookies”, text "
"files that are stored on your PC and that enables the analysis of your usage "
"of this website. The information about your usage of websites, collected "
"through these cookies, will be transmitted to and stored on Google server "
"based in the US.  On behalf of EA, Google will use this information in order "

"\n"
"5.    Ad Serving Technology \n"
"\n"
"EA’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary "
"or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web "
"beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a "
"result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help "
"track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technology enable "
"advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile "
"device and replaced while you are online.  We or third parties operating the "
"advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender "
"as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that "
"appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile "
"product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and "
"repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests "
"and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may "
"collect data for this purpose including IP address (including for purposes "
"of determining your approximate geographic location), device ID's, "
"information about your software, applications and hardware, browser "
"information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine "
"or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length "
"of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage "
"information, web pages and mobile internet sites which have been viewed by "
"you (as well as date and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, "
"advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The foregoing data may "
"be used and disclosed per this policy and the privacy policy of the company "
"providing the ad serving technology.   \n"
"\n"
"The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information "
"collected or obtained from EA with other information they have independently "
"collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and "
"services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of "
"websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their "
"own privacy policies. \n"
"\n"

"on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services can be found "

"not play. \n"
"\n"
"6.    Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all players of "
"its games. To prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may "
"negatively affect the experiences of a player, EA is authorized to use \"anti"
"-cheating\" software, or applications for the prevention of fraud for our "
"internet presence, during the use of our online products and/or services ("
"including online games), and mobile platforms.\n"
"\n"
"At login to EA online products and/or services, during the setup of an "
"Origin Account, and/or at the point of sale, EA may collect data about your "
"device in order  to create a hash of machine components.  Information "
"collected for this purpose shall not be stored in retrievable form.  EA uses "
"the collected information for the prevention of fraud, and for "
"authentication purposes. EA may consolidate the machine hash created for "
"this purpose with your Origin Account; data consolidated this way will not "
"be shared with any other third party, and will be used exclusively for "
"security, fraud prevention and authentication purposes by EA.\n"
"\n"
"V.    Information Provided To EA By Third Parties.\n"

"as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal "
"and anonymous information collected or provided directly by you. Some third "
"party services such as Twitter and Facebook may also provide us with "
"information from your accounts there with your permission. \n"
"\n"
"By playing an EA game through a social network or other third party platform "
"or service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or "
"service via one of our products and/or services, you are authorizing EA to "
"collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all "
"information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform "

"Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third "
"party social network or platform. Your agreement takes place when you "

"\n"
"A.    How EA Uses Your Information\n"
"\n"
"EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders "
"and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. "
"In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you "
"messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, "
"special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You "
"may also later opt out of such communications sent via email.\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually "
"and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our "
"products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our "
"customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for "
"authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper "
"functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In "
"addition, we combine non-personal information with personal information, "
"such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent "
"customer service, administering loyalty programs, and tailoring our "
"communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.  \n"
"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third "
"party services in our online and mobile products and services, you "
"acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your "
"contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account ("
"and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and "
"console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. "
"Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social "
"platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that "
"the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may "
"be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products "
"and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may "
"also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products "
"and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA "
"product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. "
"We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to "
"visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and "
"email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for "
"redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple "
"copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"
"Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also "
"conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public "
"display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) "
"generated through your participation.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Will EA Share My Information With Third Parties?\n"
"\n"
"EA will never share your personally identifiable information with third "
"parties without your consent.   We may, however, share non-personally "
"identifiable, aggregated and/or public information with third parties.  "

"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal "
"information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or "
"promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, "
"shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you "
"may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and "
"email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such "
"as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement "
"personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and "
"demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and "
"related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To "
"enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to "
"the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"

"informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that "
"party.\n"
"\n"
"We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal "
"communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products "
"and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply "
"with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when "
"we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address "
"potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, "
"operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, "
"or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, "
"combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal "
"process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you "
"post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public "
"information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI "
"for more details.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general "
"audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from "
"children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age "
"information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or "
"service, or we will either block such users from providing personal "
"information, or will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the "
"collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At "
"that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child "
"may make publically available, how we will user the information and other "
"practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide "
"more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or "
"mobile products and services, this may include such general audience "
"communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and "
"your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal "
"information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request "
"the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's "
"personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an "
"email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 "
"Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  "
"Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy "
"Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"
"\n"
"If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, "
"use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has "
"previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to "
"obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with "
"strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child "
"should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about "
"using the Internet safely.\n"
"\n"
"Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy "
"policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child’s "
"information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.\n"
"\n"
"Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an "
"activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal "
"information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On "
"certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless "
"of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, "
"Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of "
"contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online "
"chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in "
"similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that "
"you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted, public information, may "
"be accessed or recorded by EA employees, and there is no expectation of "
"privacy or confidentiality there.  \n"
"\n"

"in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by "
"other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited "
"messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information "

"XII.    Third Party Sites.\n"
"\n"

"not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with "
"that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on "
"an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the "

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we "
"cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at "
"arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will "
"pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your "
"arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your "
"satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after "
"attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the "
"following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This "
"provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, "
"but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member "
"States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these "
"terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to "
"participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted "
"broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), "
"including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"5. EA Services, Content and Entitlement Availability\n"
"\n"
"Entitlements may only be held in Accounts belonging to legal residents of "
"countries where access to and use of Content and Entitlements is permitted.  "
"Entitlements may be purchased or acquired only from EA or an authorized "

"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "
"violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of "
"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its "

"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access "
"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "
"visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/"

"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "

"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "

"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "

"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "

"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "
"WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN ABOUT "
"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "

"DATA, DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, AND ANY OTHER LOSS OR "
"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "

"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
" 18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "

"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "
"excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you "
"expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising "
"out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of "

"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "

"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"

"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "
"games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you "
"will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above "

"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "
"visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/"
"support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the "
"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

" As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, "
"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of "
"Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your "

"cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right "

"option to play EA Software online on servers not owned or controlled by EA.  "
"EA takes no responsibility for your use of EA Software on or through any "

"\n"
"EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates "

"computer, entertainment system or device (\"EA Software\").  EA grants to "
"you a non-exclusive, limited license to use EA Software solely for the "
"purpose stated by EA at the time the EA Software is made available to you.  "
"If an End User License Agreement or End User Access And License Agreement is "

"You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and not "
"to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content or EA "
"Software subject to restrictions under such laws to a national destination "

"types of encryption software.  The assurances and commitments in this "
"Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "

"RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE THESE UPDATES AND IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR THESE "
"CHANGES.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT "
"THE USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  "
"EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, EA PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "
"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "
"WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN ABOUT "
"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "
"SERVICES.  EA DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR USE ANY "
"CONTENT, ENTITLEMENTS, GOODS OR SERVICES.  EA PROVIDES EA SERVICES ON A "
"COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE "
"TO ACCESS OR USE EA SERVICES AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, OR THAT "
"EA WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR EA SERVICES AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC "

"EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID TO EA FOR EA SERVICES.  IN NO CASE SHALL EA, "
"ITS LICENSORS OR EA AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL "
"DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, THE INTERNET OR "
"FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES OR "
"ACCOUNTS.  WHILE EA USES COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MEANS TO PROTECT YOUR "
"PERSONAL INFORMATION, EA AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF "
"DATA, DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, AND ANY OTHER LOSS OR "
"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "
"WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH EA "

"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "
"distribution of any Content on or through EA Services.  Without limiting the "
"generality of the foregoing, you agree to indemnify and hold EA and its "

"communication and activity on EA Services, including any Content you "
"contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA, EA's licensors "
"and EA Affiliates from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on "
"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
" 18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."

"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "

"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "

"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"

"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "
"games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you "

"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "

"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"

"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"

"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"

"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "

"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "

"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "

"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "

"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "

"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"\n"
"Some products may give you the option of using EA Software on or through a "
"service that is not controlled by EA.  For example, you may be given the "
"option to play EA Software online on servers not owned or controlled by EA.  "
"EA takes no responsibility for your use of EA Software on or through any "
"such service and otherwise has no control over how those services are "
"offered, administered or operated.  Any such use of non-EA controlled "
"services is at your own risk and may subject you to additional or different "
"terms and restrictions by the third party running the service. \n"
"\n"
"13. Software, Utilities and Tools\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates "
"or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your "
"computer, entertainment system or device (\"EA Software\").  EA grants to "
"you a non-exclusive, limited license to use EA Software solely for the "
"purpose stated by EA at the time the EA Software is made available to you.  "
"If an End User License Agreement or End User Access And License Agreement is "

"terms of that license agreement.  You may not sub-license, or charge others "
"to use or access EA Software.  You may not translate, reverse-engineer, "
"reverse-compile or decompile, disassemble or make derivative works from EA "

"any person or place, to which the United States, the European Union, or any "
"other jurisdiction has embargoed goods.\n"
"\n"
"You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and not "
"to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content or EA "
"Software subject to restrictions under such laws to a national destination "

"any requisite government authorization.  You further agree not to upload to "
"EA Services any data or software that cannot be exported without prior "
"written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain "
"types of encryption software.  The assurances and commitments in this "
"Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "
"TO BALANCE GAME PLAY AND USAGE OF EA SERVICES.  THESE UPDATES OR \"RESETS\" "
"MAY CAUSE YOU SETBACKS WITHIN THE RELEVANT GAME WORLD AND MAY AFFECT "
"CHARACTERS, GAMES, GROUPS OR OTHER ENTITLEMENTS UNDER YOUR CONTROL.  EA "
"RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE THESE UPDATES AND IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR THESE "
"CHANGES.\n"
"\n"
"16. Limitations on Warranty and Liability\n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT "
"THE USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  "
"EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, EA PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "
"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "
"WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN ABOUT "
"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "
"SERVICES.  EA DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR USE ANY "
"CONTENT, ENTITLEMENTS, GOODS OR SERVICES.  EA PROVIDES EA SERVICES ON A "
"COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE "
"TO ACCESS OR USE EA SERVICES AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, OR THAT "
"EA WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR EA SERVICES AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC "
"GEOGRAPHIC AREA. \n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH EA OR ITS LICENSORS "
"ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO EA SERVICES AND/OR EA PRODUCTS IS TO STOP "
"USING EA SERVICES, AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT EA, ITS LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACT "
"OR FAILURE TO ACT BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING CONDUCT, "
"COMMUNICATION OR CONTENT ON EA SERVICES OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE.  IN NO CASE "
"SHALL EA'S OR ITS LICENSORS', LICENSEES', AFFILIATES', EMPLOYEES', "
"OFFICERS', OR DIRECTORS' (COLLECTIVELY, \"EA AFFILIATES\") LIABILITY TO YOU "
"EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID TO EA FOR EA SERVICES.  IN NO CASE SHALL EA, "
"ITS LICENSORS OR EA AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL "
"DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, THE INTERNET OR "
"FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES OR "
"ACCOUNTS.  WHILE EA USES COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MEANS TO PROTECT YOUR "
"PERSONAL INFORMATION, EA AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF "
"DATA, DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, AND ANY OTHER LOSS OR "
"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "
"WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH EA "
"AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY "
"TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.\n"
"\n"
"17. Indemnification\n"
"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "
"distribution of any Content on or through EA Services.  Without limiting the "
"generality of the foregoing, you agree to indemnify and hold EA and its "
"licensors harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account, "
"including the illegal or improper use of your Account by someone to whom you "
"have given permission to use your Account.  You agree that you will be "
"personally responsible for your use of EA Services and for all of your "
"communication and activity on EA Services, including any Content you "
"contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA, EA's licensors "
"and EA Affiliates from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on "
"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
" 18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."
"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "
"parties to this Terms of Service.  You also understand and agree that this "
"Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms "
"incorporated into this Terms of Service, including EA's enforcement of those "
"policies, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or "
"remedies upon any person.\n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "

"Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of "
"such courts. If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of "
"California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of "
"Service and your Account(s); and (ii) to the extent applicable pursuant to "
"Section 20, below, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any "
"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "

"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"

"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "

"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that "
"you and other users may contribute to EA Services. You are solely "
"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "
"violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of "
"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its "
"licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable "
"and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, "
"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access "
"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "
"visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/"
"support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the "
"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "

"Some products may give you the option of using EA Software on or through a "
"service that is not controlled by EA.  For example, you may be given the "
"option to play EA Software online on servers not owned or controlled by EA.  "
"EA takes no responsibility for your use of EA Software on or through any "

"offered, administered or operated.  Any such use of non-EA controlled "
"services is at your own risk and may subject you to additional or different "
"terms and restrictions by the third party running the service. \n"
"\n"
"13. Software, Utilities and Tools\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates "
"or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your "
"computer, entertainment system or device (\"EA Software\").  EA grants to "
"you a non-exclusive, limited license to use EA Software solely for the "
"purpose stated by EA at the time the EA Software is made available to you.  "
"If an End User License Agreement or End User Access And License Agreement is "

"terms of that license agreement.  You may not sub-license, or charge others "
"to use or access EA Software.  You may not translate, reverse-engineer, "

"any person or place, to which the United States, the European Union, or any "
"other jurisdiction has embargoed goods.\n"
"\n"
"You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and not "
"to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content or EA "
"Software subject to restrictions under such laws to a national destination "

"any requisite government authorization.  You further agree not to upload to "
"EA Services any data or software that cannot be exported without prior "
"written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain "
"types of encryption software.  The assurances and commitments in this "
"Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "
"TO BALANCE GAME PLAY AND USAGE OF EA SERVICES.  THESE UPDATES OR \"RESETS\" "
"MAY CAUSE YOU SETBACKS WITHIN THE RELEVANT GAME WORLD AND MAY AFFECT "
"CHARACTERS, GAMES, GROUPS OR OTHER ENTITLEMENTS UNDER YOUR CONTROL.  EA "
"RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE THESE UPDATES AND IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR THESE "
"CHANGES.\n"
"\n"
"16. Limitations on Warranty and Liability\n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT "
"THE USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  "
"EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, EA PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "
"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "
"WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN ABOUT "
"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "
"SERVICES.  EA DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR USE ANY "
"CONTENT, ENTITLEMENTS, GOODS OR SERVICES.  EA PROVIDES EA SERVICES ON A "
"COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE "
"TO ACCESS OR USE EA SERVICES AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, OR THAT "
"EA WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR EA SERVICES AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC "
"GEOGRAPHIC AREA. \n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH EA OR ITS LICENSORS "
"ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO EA SERVICES AND/OR EA PRODUCTS IS TO STOP "
"USING EA SERVICES, AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT EA, ITS LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACT "
"OR FAILURE TO ACT BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING CONDUCT, "
"COMMUNICATION OR CONTENT ON EA SERVICES OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE.  IN NO CASE "
"SHALL EA'S OR ITS LICENSORS', LICENSEES', AFFILIATES', EMPLOYEES', "
"OFFICERS', OR DIRECTORS' (COLLECTIVELY, \"EA AFFILIATES\") LIABILITY TO YOU "
"EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID TO EA FOR EA SERVICES.  IN NO CASE SHALL EA, "
"ITS LICENSORS OR EA AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL "
"DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, THE INTERNET OR "
"FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES OR "
"ACCOUNTS.  WHILE EA USES COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MEANS TO PROTECT YOUR "
"PERSONAL INFORMATION, EA AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF "
"DATA, DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, AND ANY OTHER LOSS OR "
"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "
"WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH EA "
"AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY "
"TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.\n"
"\n"
"17. Indemnification\n"
"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "
"distribution of any Content on or through EA Services.  Without limiting the "
"generality of the foregoing, you agree to indemnify and hold EA and its "
"licensors harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account, "
"including the illegal or improper use of your Account by someone to whom you "
"have given permission to use your Account.  You agree that you will be "
"personally responsible for your use of EA Services and for all of your "
"communication and activity on EA Services, including any Content you "
"contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA, EA's licensors "
"and EA Affiliates from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on "
"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
" 18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."
"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "
"parties to this Terms of Service.  You also understand and agree that this "
"Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms "
"incorporated into this Terms of Service, including EA's enforcement of those "
"policies, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or "
"remedies upon any person.\n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "
"excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you "
"expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising "
"out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of "
"Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of "
"such courts. If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of "
"California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of "
"Service and your Account(s); and (ii) to the extent applicable pursuant to "
"Section 20, below, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any "
"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "
"Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the federal and state "
"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"

"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"

"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "

"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that "
"you and other users may contribute to EA Services. You are solely "
"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "
"violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of "
"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its "
"licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable "

"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access "
"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "
"visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/"
"support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"10. Cancellation of your Account\n"

"EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of "
"Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your "

"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "

"including the illegal or improper use of your Account by someone to whom you "
"have given permission to use your Account.  You agree that you will be "

"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."
"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "
"parties to this Terms of Service.  You also understand and agree that this "
"Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms "

"remedies upon any person.\n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "

"such courts. If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of "
"California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of "
"Service and your Account(s); and (ii) to the extent applicable pursuant to "
"Section 20, below, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any "
"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "
"Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the federal and state "
"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"

"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."

"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that "
"you and other users may contribute to EA Services. You are solely "
"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "
"violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of "
"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"

"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"

"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "

"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "

"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"access and record your activities.  EA reserves the right to remove any "
"content from any EA Service at EA's sole discretion.  EA has no liability "

"12. Services Not Controlled By EA\n"
"\n"
"Some products may give you the option of using EA Software on or through a "
"service that is not controlled by EA.  For example, you may be given the "
"option to play EA Software online on servers not owned or controlled by EA.  "
"EA takes no responsibility for your use of EA Software on or through any "
"such service and otherwise has no control over how those services are "
"offered, administered or operated.  Any such use of non-EA controlled "
"services is at your own risk and may subject you to additional or different "
"terms and restrictions by the third party running the service. \n"
"\n"
"13. Software, Utilities and Tools\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates "
"or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your "
"computer, entertainment system or device (\"EA Software\").  EA grants to "
"you a non-exclusive, limited license to use EA Software solely for the "
"purpose stated by EA at the time the EA Software is made available to you.  "
"If an End User License Agreement or End User Access And License Agreement is "
"provided with the EA Software, your use of the EA Software is subject to the "
"terms of that license agreement.  You may not sub-license, or charge others "
"to use or access EA Software.  You may not translate, reverse-engineer, "
"reverse-compile or decompile, disassemble or make derivative works from EA "
"Software.  You may not modify EA Software or use it in any way not expressly "
"authorized in writing by EA.  You understand that EA's introduction of "
"various technologies may not be consistent across all platforms and that the "
"performance of EA Software and related EA Services may vary depending on "
"your computer and other equipment.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, Electronic Arts may provide you with updates or "
"modifications to EA Software.  You understand that certain updates and "
"modifications may be required in order to continue use the EA Software and "
"EA Services.\n"
"\n"
"14. Export Control Laws\n"
"\n"
"EA Software may be subject to United States export controls, and export "
"controls of other jurisdictions.  By downloading EA Software from EA, you "
"warrant that you are not located in any country, or exporting EA Software to "
"any person or place, to which the United States, the European Union, or any "
"other jurisdiction has embargoed goods.\n"
"\n"
"You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and not "
"to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content or EA "
"Software subject to restrictions under such laws to a national destination "
"prohibited by such laws, without first obtaining, and then complying with, "
"any requisite government authorization.  You further agree not to upload to "
"EA Services any data or software that cannot be exported without prior "
"written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain "
"types of encryption software.  The assurances and commitments in this "
"Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "
"TO BALANCE GAME PLAY AND USAGE OF EA SERVICES.  THESE UPDATES OR \"RESETS\" "
"MAY CAUSE YOU SETBACKS WITHIN THE RELEVANT GAME WORLD AND MAY AFFECT "
"CHARACTERS, GAMES, GROUPS OR OTHER ENTITLEMENTS UNDER YOUR CONTROL.  EA "
"RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE THESE UPDATES AND IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR THESE "
"CHANGES.\n"
"\n"
"16. Limitations on Warranty and Liability\n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT "
"THE USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  "
"EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, EA PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "
"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "
"WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN ABOUT "
"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "
"SERVICES.  EA DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR USE ANY "
"CONTENT, ENTITLEMENTS, GOODS OR SERVICES.  EA PROVIDES EA SERVICES ON A "
"COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE "
"TO ACCESS OR USE EA SERVICES AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, OR THAT "
"EA WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR EA SERVICES AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC "
"GEOGRAPHIC AREA. \n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH EA OR ITS LICENSORS "
"ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO EA SERVICES AND/OR EA PRODUCTS IS TO STOP "
"USING EA SERVICES, AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT EA, ITS LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACT "
"OR FAILURE TO ACT BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING CONDUCT, "
"COMMUNICATION OR CONTENT ON EA SERVICES OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE.  IN NO CASE "
"SHALL EA'S OR ITS LICENSORS', LICENSEES', AFFILIATES', EMPLOYEES', "
"OFFICERS', OR DIRECTORS' (COLLECTIVELY, \"EA AFFILIATES\") LIABILITY TO YOU "
"EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID TO EA FOR EA SERVICES.  IN NO CASE SHALL EA, "
"ITS LICENSORS OR EA AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL "
"DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, THE INTERNET OR "
"FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES OR "
"ACCOUNTS.  WHILE EA USES COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MEANS TO PROTECT YOUR "
"PERSONAL INFORMATION, EA AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF "
"DATA, DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, AND ANY OTHER LOSS OR "
"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "
"WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH EA "
"AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY "
"TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.\n"
"\n"
"17. Indemnification\n"
"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "
"distribution of any Content on or through EA Services.  Without limiting the "
"generality of the foregoing, you agree to indemnify and hold EA and its "
"licensors harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account, "
"including the illegal or improper use of your Account by someone to whom you "
"have given permission to use your Account.  You agree that you will be "
"personally responsible for your use of EA Services and for all of your "
"communication and activity on EA Services, including any Content you "
"contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA, EA's licensors "
"and EA Affiliates from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on "
"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."
"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "
"parties to this Terms of Service.  You also understand and agree that this "
"Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms "
"incorporated into this Terms of Service, including EA's enforcement of those "
"policies, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or "
"remedies upon any person.\n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "
"excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you "
"expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising "
"out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of "
"Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of "
"such courts. If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of "
"California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of "
"Service and your Account(s); and (ii) to the extent applicable pursuant to "
"Section 20, below, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any "
"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "
"Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the federal and state "
"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"
"22. Notice to California Residents \n"
"\n"
"Pursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 1789.3, please note that (a) EA is located at "
"209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065, (b) The fees and charges "
"for EA Services vary depending on the services selected by you, and (c) If "

"\n"
"Bookmark terms.ea.com and visit this site regularly for updates to EA Terms "
"of Service.\n"
"\n"
"23. Supplemental Terms\n"
"\n"
"Additional Terms and Conditions for Specific EA Services\n"
"\n"
"Certain EA Services may require you to read and agree to terms and "
"conditions that are specific to that EA Service.  Your right to use that EA "
"Service is subject to those specific terms and this Terms of Service.  If "
"there are any inconsistencies between the specific terms and these terms, EA "
"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "
"games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you "
"will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above "
"and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Test accounts are non-transferable under any circumstances.\n"

"times, in all countries and/or geographic locations, or at any given time or "
"that we will continue to offer particular Content or Entitlements for any "
"particular length of time. We reserve the right to change and update Content "

"for other Entitlements or for cash, or other goods or services.  \n"
"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that "
"you and other users may contribute to EA Services.  You are solely "
"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "

"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms.  The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion.  To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others \n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its "
"licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable "
"and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, "
"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access "
"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you. \n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services \n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic). \n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "
"visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/"
"support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the "
"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  \n"
"\n"
"As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, "
"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends. \n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates. \n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"10. Cancellation of your Account\n"

"You have the right to cancel your Account or a particular subscription to an "
"EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of "
"Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your "
"Account or applicable subscriptions.  You understand and agree that the "
"cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right "
"and remedy with respect to any dispute with EA, including any dispute "
"related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Terms of Service or EA's "
"enforcement or application of this Terms of Service; (2) the Content and "

"\n"
"Contact EA's Customer Service Department at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com ("

"or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a subscription to an EA "
"Service.  You are also responsible for any amounts owed to third-party "
"vendors or content providers before your cancellation.  Any delinquent or "

"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "

"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "

"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.  \n"
"\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "

"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. \n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "
"excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you "

"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "
"Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the federal and state "
"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. \n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory; \n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); \n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"  \n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights; \n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will: \n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and \n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\"). \n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"  \n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision. \n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"
"22. Notice to California Residents  \n"

"23. Supplemental Terms\n"
"\n"
"Additional Terms and Conditions for Specific EA Services\n"
"\n"
"Certain EA Services may require you to read and agree to terms and "
"conditions that are specific to that EA Service.  Your right to use that EA "
"Service is subject to those specific terms and this Terms of Service.  If "

"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.  \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "
"games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you "
"will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above "
"and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"

"Entitlements to which you have access for your personal, private, non-"
"commercial, non-transferable, limited uses solely as set forth herein and as "
"set forth in any additional documentation and/or agreements applicable to "

"so.  In addition, unless expressly authorized by EA, you may not distribute, "
"publicly perform or display, lease, sell, transmit, transfer, publish, edit, "
"copy, create derivative works from, rent, sub-license, decompile, "
"disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise make unauthorized use of Content "
"or Entitlements.  Any commercial use is prohibited.  You agree not to "
"remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary "
"rights notices affixed to Content.  Your rights are subject to your "
"compliance with these Terms of Service as well as any other agreements "
"applicable to the EA Services you are using.  \n"
"\n"
"EA reserves all right, title and interest in Content, Entitlements and all "
"associated copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights "
"therein that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms of Service.  "
"Your permitted use of Content and Entitlements described above is limited by "
"the intellectual property rights of EA and does not include any rights to "
"other patents or intellectual property.  Making unauthorized copies or "
"distribution of Content and/or Entitlements found on EA Services may result "
"in the termination of your Account(s), prohibition on use of EA Services, "
"and further legal action.  Content and/or Entitlement owners may take "
"criminal or civil action against you for unauthorized use of intellectual "
"property. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless EA from any unauthorized "
"or illegal conduct by you, or through the use of your Account, on EA "
"Services.\n"
"\n"
"5. EA Services, Content and Entitlement Availability\n"
"\n"
"Entitlements may only be held in Accounts belonging to legal residents of "
"countries where access to and use of Content and Entitlements is permitted.  "
"Entitlements may be purchased or acquired only from EA or an authorized "
"retailer.  EA reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire "
"Entitlements, and EA reserves the right to limit or block any request to "
"acquire Entitlements for any reason.  \n"
"\n"
"We do not guarantee that any Content or Entitlement will be available at all "
"times, in all countries and/or geographic locations, or at any given time or "
"that we will continue to offer particular Content or Entitlements for any "
"particular length of time. We reserve the right to change and update Content "
"and Entitlements without notice to you.  Once you have redeemed your "
"Entitlements, that content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable "
"for other Entitlements or for cash, or other goods or services.  \n"
"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that "
"you and other users may contribute to EA Services.  You are solely "
"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "
"violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of "
"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms.  The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion.  To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others \n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its "
"licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable "
"and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, "
"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access "
"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you. \n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services \n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic). \n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "
"visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/"
"support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the "
"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  \n"
"\n"
"As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, "
"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends. \n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates. \n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"10. Cancellation of your Account\n"
"\n"
"You have the right to cancel your Account or a particular subscription to an "
"EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of "
"Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your "
"Account or applicable subscriptions.  You understand and agree that the "
"cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right "
"and remedy with respect to any dispute with EA, including any dispute "
"related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Terms of Service or EA's "
"enforcement or application of this Terms of Service; (2) the Content and "
"Entitlements available through EA Services or any change in Content or "
"Entitlements provided through EA Services; (3) your ability to access and/or "
"use EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon; or (4) the "
"amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, billing methods, or "
"any change to the fees, applicable taxes, surcharges or billing methods for "
"EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon.\n"
"\n"
"Contact EA's Customer Service Department at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com ("
"for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic) "
"to cancel your Account.  EA reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges "
"or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a subscription to an EA "
"Service.  You are also responsible for any amounts owed to third-party "
"vendors or content providers before your cancellation.  Any delinquent or "
"unpaid fees and other unresolved issues with EA Services must be settled "
"before you establish a new Account.\n"

"\n"
"Some products may give you the option of using EA Software on or through a "
"service that is not controlled by EA.  For example, you may be given the "
"option to play EA Software online on servers not owned or controlled by EA.  "
"EA takes no responsibility for your use of EA Software on or through any "

"offered, administered or operated.  Any such use of non-EA controlled "
"services is at your own risk and may subject you to additional or different "
"terms and restrictions by the third party running the service.  \n"
"\n"
"13. Software, Utilities and Tools\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates "
"or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your "
"computer, entertainment system or device (\"EA Software\").  EA grants to "
"you a non-exclusive, limited license to use EA Software solely for the "
"purpose stated by EA at the time the EA Software is made available to you.  "
"If an End User License Agreement or End User Access And License Agreement is "

"authorized in writing by EA.  You understand that EA's introduction of "
"various technologies may not be consistent across all platforms and that the "
"performance of EA Software and related EA Services may vary depending on "
"your computer and other equipment.\n"
"\n"
"From time to time, Electronic Arts may provide you with updates or "
"modifications to EA Software.  You understand that certain updates and "
"modifications may be required in order to continue use the EA Software and "
"EA Services.\n"

"warrant that you are not located in any country, or exporting EA Software to "
"any person or place, to which the United States, the European Union, or any "
"other jurisdiction has embargoed goods.\n"
"\n"
"You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and not "
"to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content or EA "
"Software subject to restrictions under such laws to a national destination "
"prohibited by such laws, without first obtaining, and then complying with, "
"any requisite government authorization.  You further agree not to upload to "
"EA Services any data or software that cannot be exported without prior "
"written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain "
"types of encryption software.  The assurances and commitments in this "
"Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "
"TO BALANCE GAME PLAY AND USAGE OF EA SERVICES.  THESE UPDATES OR \"RESETS\" "
"MAY CAUSE YOU SETBACKS WITHIN THE RELEVANT GAME WORLD AND MAY AFFECT "
"CHARACTERS, GAMES, GROUPS OR OTHER ENTITLEMENTS UNDER YOUR CONTROL.  EA "

"16. Limitations on Warranty and Liability\n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT "
"THE USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  "
"EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, EA PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "
"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "
"WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN ABOUT "
"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "
"SERVICES.  EA DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR USE ANY "
"CONTENT, ENTITLEMENTS, GOODS OR SERVICES.  EA PROVIDES EA SERVICES ON A "
"COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE "
"TO ACCESS OR USE EA SERVICES AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, OR THAT "
"EA WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR EA SERVICES AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC "
"GEOGRAPHIC AREA.  \n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH EA OR ITS LICENSORS "
"ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO EA SERVICES AND/OR EA PRODUCTS IS TO STOP "
"USING EA SERVICES, AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT EA, ITS LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACT "
"OR FAILURE TO ACT BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING CONDUCT, "
"COMMUNICATION OR CONTENT ON EA SERVICES OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE.  IN NO CASE "
"SHALL EA'S OR ITS LICENSORS', LICENSEES', AFFILIATES', EMPLOYEES', "
"OFFICERS', OR DIRECTORS' (COLLECTIVELY, \"EA AFFILIATES\") LIABILITY TO YOU "
"EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID TO EA FOR EA SERVICES.  IN NO CASE SHALL EA, "

"DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, THE INTERNET OR "

"PERSONAL INFORMATION, EA AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF "
"DATA, DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, AND ANY OTHER LOSS OR "
"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "
"WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH EA "
"AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY "
"TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.\n"
"\n"
"17. Indemnification\n"
"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "
"distribution of any Content on or through EA Services.  Without limiting the "
"generality of the foregoing, you agree to indemnify and hold EA and its "
"licensors harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account, "
"including the illegal or improper use of your Account by someone to whom you "
"have given permission to use your Account.  You agree that you will be "
"personally responsible for your use of EA Services and for all of your "
"communication and activity on EA Services, including any Content you "
"contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA, EA's licensors "
"and EA Affiliates from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on "
"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.  \n"
"\n"
"18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."
"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "
"parties to this Terms of Service.  You also understand and agree that this "
"Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms "
"incorporated into this Terms of Service, including EA's enforcement of those "
"policies, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or "
"remedies upon any person. \n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. \n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "
"excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you "
"expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising "
"out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of "
"Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of "
"such courts.  If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of "
"California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of "
"Service and your Account(s); and (ii) to the extent applicable pursuant to "
"Section 20, below, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any "
"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "
"Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the federal and state "
"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. \n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory; \n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); \n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"  \n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights; \n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will: \n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and \n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\"). \n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"  \n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision. \n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"
"22. Notice to California Residents  \n"

"23. Supplemental Terms\n"
"\n"
"Additional Terms and Conditions for Specific EA Services\n"
"\n"
"Certain EA Services may require you to read and agree to terms and "
"conditions that are specific to that EA Service.  Your right to use that EA "
"Service is subject to those specific terms and this Terms of Service.  If "

"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.  \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "
"games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you "
"will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above "
"and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"

"therein that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms of Service.  "
"Your permitted use of Content and Entitlements described above is limited by "
"the intellectual property rights of EA and does not include any rights to "

"criminal or civil action against you for unauthorized use of intellectual "
"property. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless EA from any unauthorized "

"Services.\n"
"\n"
"5. EA Services, Content and Entitlement Availability\n"
"\n"
"Entitlements may only be held in Accounts belonging to legal residents of "
"countries where access to and use of Content and Entitlements is permitted.  "
"Entitlements may be purchased or acquired only from EA or an authorized "
"retailer.  EA reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire "
"Entitlements, and EA reserves the right to limit or block any request to "
"acquire Entitlements for any reason.\n"
"\n"
"We do not guarantee that any Content or Entitlement will be available at all "
"times, in all countries and/or geographic locations, or at any given time or "
"that we will continue to offer particular Content or Entitlements for any "
"particular length of time. We reserve the right to change and update Content "
"and Entitlements without notice to you.  Once you have redeemed your "
"Entitlements, that content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable "
"for other Entitlements or for cash, or other goods or services. \n"
"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that "
"you and other users may contribute to EA Services. You are solely "
"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "
"violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of "
"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its "
"licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable "
"and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, "
"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access "
"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "
"visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/"
"support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the "
"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, "
"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "
"more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all "
"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"10. Cancellation of your Account\n"
"\n"
"You have the right to cancel your Account or a particular subscription to an "
"EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of "
"Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your "
"Account or applicable subscriptions.  You understand and agree that the "
"cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right "
"and remedy with respect to any dispute with EA, including any dispute "
"related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Terms of Service or EA's "
"enforcement or application of this Terms of Service; (2) the Content and "
"Entitlements available through EA Services or any change in Content or "
"Entitlements provided through EA Services; (3) your ability to access and/or "
"use EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon; or (4) the "
"amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, billing methods, or "
"any change to the fees, applicable taxes, surcharges or billing methods for "
"EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon.\n"
"\n"
"Contact EA's Customer Service Department at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com ("
"for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic) "
"to cancel your Account.  EA reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges "
"or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a subscription to an EA "
"Service.  You are also responsible for any amounts owed to third-party "
"vendors or content providers before your cancellation.  Any delinquent or "
"unpaid fees and other unresolved issues with EA Services must be settled "
"before you establish a new Account.\n"

"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "
"TO BALANCE GAME PLAY AND USAGE OF EA SERVICES.  THESE UPDATES OR \"RESETS\" "

"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT "
"THE USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  "
"EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, EA PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "
"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "

"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "
"SERVICES.  EA DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR USE ANY "

"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH EA OR ITS LICENSORS "
"ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO EA SERVICES AND/OR EA PRODUCTS IS TO STOP "

"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "
"WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH EA "
"AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY "
"TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.\n"
"\n"
"17. Indemnification\n"
"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "
"distribution of any Content on or through EA Services.  Without limiting the "
"generality of the foregoing, you agree to indemnify and hold EA and its "
"licensors harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account, "
"including the illegal or improper use of your Account by someone to whom you "
"have given permission to use your Account.  You agree that you will be "

"and EA Affiliates from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on "
"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."
"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "
"parties to this Terms of Service.  You also understand and agree that this "
"Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms "
"incorporated into this Terms of Service, including EA's enforcement of those "
"policies, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or "
"remedies upon any person.\n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "
"excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you "
"expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising "
"out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of "
"Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of "
"such courts. If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of "
"California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of "
"Service and your Account(s); and (ii) to the extent applicable pursuant to "
"Section 20, below, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any "
"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "
"Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the federal and state "
"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"

"conditions that are specific to that EA Service.  Your right to use that EA "

"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "
"games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you "
"will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above "

"\n"
"Entitlements may only be held in Accounts belonging to legal residents of "

"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that "
"you and other users may contribute to EA Services. You are solely "
"responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the "
"legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any "
"UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other "
"intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that "
"violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of "
"privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are "
"permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to "
"you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual "
"property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of "
"EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may "
"terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are "
"terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and "
"you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to "
"remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA "
"determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or "
"other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the "
"maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any "
"responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to "
"or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its "
"licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable "
"and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, "
"archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, "
"license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise "
"communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion "
"thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known "
"or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to "
"you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, "
"consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for "
"such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar "
"rights you may have in such UGC.\n"

"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access "
"and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other "
"users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, "
"perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and "
"distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further "
"notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay "
"the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For "
"information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If "
"you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will "
"provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at "
"least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA "
"Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely "
"notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) "
"days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such "
"changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your "
"subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have "
"accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we "
"will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is "
"subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, "
"in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, "

"support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the "
"particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable "
"to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  "
"When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you "
"represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other "
"payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to "
"permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by "
"charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your "
"subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the "
"expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater "
"than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount "
"pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, "
"complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must "
"promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, "
"complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card "
"number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if "
"your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to "
"such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing "
"information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any "
"subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at "
"least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA "
"reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to "
"obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  "
"Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an "
"additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically "
"renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, "
"support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star "
"Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that "
"uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial "
"subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to "
"bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription "
"expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are "
"always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless "
"and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even "
"when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not "
"transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to "
"other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which "
"are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  "
"Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with "
"third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services ("
"and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such "
"termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular "
"EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, "
"then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s "
"discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product "
"or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of "
"Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services "
"renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or "
"improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's "
"Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may "
"lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have "

"related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service "
"or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may "
"issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or "
"garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately "
"terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily "
"or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services "
"or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not "
"required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate "
"your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or "
"all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements "
"associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not "
"participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA "
"reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services "
"to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been "
"terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated "
"with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are "
"selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your "
"device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA "
"Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you "
"or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no "
"further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account "
"or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken "
"against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain "
"types of encryption software.  The assurances and commitments in this "
"Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"15. Updates to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT: EA MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO UPDATE, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS "
"TO BALANCE GAME PLAY AND USAGE OF EA SERVICES.  THESE UPDATES OR \"RESETS\" "

"\n"
"16. Limitations on Warranty and Liability\n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT "
"THE USE OF EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  "
"EA SERVICES, EA SOFTWARE, EA PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "
"ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS FOR YOUR USE, "
"WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH "
"WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION.  NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN ABOUT "
"THE QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF EA SOFTWARE OR EA "
"SERVICES.  EA DOES NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR INABILITY TO OBTAIN OR USE ANY "
"CONTENT, ENTITLEMENTS, GOODS OR SERVICES.  EA PROVIDES EA SERVICES ON A "
"COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE "
"TO ACCESS OR USE EA SERVICES AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING, OR THAT "
"EA WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR EA SERVICES AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC "
"GEOGRAPHIC AREA. \n"
"\n"
"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH EA OR ITS LICENSORS "
"ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO EA SERVICES AND/OR EA PRODUCTS IS TO STOP "
"USING EA SERVICES, AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE "
"THAT EA, ITS LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACT "
"OR FAILURE TO ACT BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING CONDUCT, "
"COMMUNICATION OR CONTENT ON EA SERVICES OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE.  IN NO CASE "
"SHALL EA'S OR ITS LICENSORS', LICENSEES', AFFILIATES', EMPLOYEES', "
"OFFICERS', OR DIRECTORS' (COLLECTIVELY, \"EA AFFILIATES\") LIABILITY TO YOU "
"EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID TO EA FOR EA SERVICES.  IN NO CASE SHALL EA, "

"DATA, DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, AND ANY OTHER LOSS OR "
"DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, "
"INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL AND HOWEVER ARISING, AS A RESULT OF "
"ACCESSING OR USING ANY EA SERVICE, CONTENT, EA SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND/"
"OR DEVICE.\n"
"\n"
"BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE "
"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH "
"STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EA'S, EA'S LICENSORS' AND EA AFFILIATES' LIABILITY "
"SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  EA DOES NOT ENDORSE, "
"WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH EA "
"AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY "
"TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.\n"
"\n"
"17. Indemnification\n"
"\n"
"Upon EA's and/or its licensors' request, you agree to defend, indemnify and "
"hold harmless EA, its licensors and EA Affiliates, contractors, vendors, and "
"content providers from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including "
"attorneys' fees, that arise from or relate to a breach of these Terms of "
"Service for which you are responsible or in connection with your "
"distribution of any Content on or through EA Services.  Without limiting the "
"generality of the foregoing, you agree to indemnify and hold EA and its "
"licensors harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account, "
"including the illegal or improper use of your Account by someone to whom you "
"have given permission to use your Account.  You agree that you will be "
"personally responsible for your use of EA Services and for all of your "
"communication and activity on EA Services, including any Content you "
"contribute, and that you will indemnify and hold harmless EA, EA's licensors "
"and EA Affiliates from any liability or damages arising from your conduct on "
"EA Services, including any Content that you contribute.\n"
"\n"
"EA and its licensors reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the "
"exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to "
"indemnification by you.  In that event, you shall have no further obligation "
"to provide indemnification to EA and/or its licensors in that matter.  This "
"Section shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"18. Links to Third-Party Sites\n"
"\n"
"EA Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties "
"including advertisers and other content providers.  Those sites may collect "
"data or solicit personal information from you.  EA does not control such web "
"sites, and is not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for "
"the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect."
"\n"
"\n"
"19. General Terms\n"
"\n"
"A. Remedies.  You agree that this Terms of Service is not intended to confer "
"and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the "
"parties to this Terms of Service.  You also understand and agree that this "
"Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms "
"incorporated into this Terms of Service, including EA's enforcement of those "
"policies, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or "
"remedies upon any person.\n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or "
"unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with "
"applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of "
"EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision "
"of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or "
"provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be "
"effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i)"
" the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this "
"Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that "
"exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any "
"way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of "
"England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such "
"dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, "
"contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you "
"reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, "
"excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you "
"expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising "
"out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of "
"Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of "
"such courts. If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of "
"California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of "
"Service and your Account(s); and (ii) to the extent applicable pursuant to "
"Section 20, below, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any "
"claim or dispute with EA, arising out of or relating in any way to your "
"Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the federal and state "
"courts within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the "
"Northern District of California, and you further agree and expressly consent "
"(to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 20, below), to the exercise of "
"personal jurisdiction in such courts in connection with any such dispute not "
"precluded by Section 20 below  including any claim involving EA or EA "
"Affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, vendors and content providers.  As "
"noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, "
"national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for "
"resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in "
"Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are "
"awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you ("
"if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over "
"and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by "
"logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at "
"help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support ("
"for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot "
"resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it "
"has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to "
"be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between "
"us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable "
"by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the "
"Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By "
"accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by "
"jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be "
"interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us "
"(“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship "
"between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, "
"misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, "
"but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation "
"in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your "
"or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or "
"unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from "
"initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective "
"subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, "
"successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or "
"beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between "
"us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate "
"commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation "
"and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive "
"termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first "
"attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before "
"initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of "
"written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices "
"of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the "
"complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;"
" and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send "
"its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or "
"to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of "
"Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City "
"CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute "
"through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of "
"Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and "
"exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by "
"one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY "
"THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE "
"A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the "
"Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) "
"and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer "
"Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the "
"AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator "
"compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, "
"limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the "
"arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of "
"Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees "
"required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all "
"arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, "
"through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator "
"will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if "
"requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and "
"any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA "
"may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending "
"arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award "
"entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited "
"to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent "
"permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) "
"there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class "
"action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no "
"right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported "
"representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other "
"persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY "
"IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER "
"IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both "
"you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one "
"person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a "
"representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to "
"be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be "
"null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration "
"will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For "
"residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the "
"County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you "
"and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order "
"to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to "
"confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the "
"arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor "
"on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that "
"is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made "
"before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your "
"arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse "
"any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your "
"attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your "
"claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and "
"reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the "
"attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from "
"either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any "
"right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, "
"although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or "
"costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees "
"and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award "
"declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party "
"seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted "
"by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this "
"Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to "
"this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you "
"may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of "
"the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting "
"any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute "
"between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental "
"Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or "
"instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes "
"constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights "
"and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between "
"the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA "
"Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"
"22. Notice to California Residents \n"
"\n"
"Pursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 1789.3, please note that (a) EA is located at "
"209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065, (b) The fees and charges "
"for EA Services vary depending on the services selected by you, and (c) If "
"you have a complaint regarding EA Services or desire further information on "
"use of EA Services, visit EA's Customer Support web pages at help.ea.com, "

"\n"
"Bookmark terms.ea.com and visit this site regularly for updates to EA Terms "
"of Service.\n"
"\n"
"23. Supplemental Terms\n"
"\n"
"Additional Terms and Conditions for Specific EA Services\n"
"\n"
"Certain EA Services may require you to read and agree to terms and "
"conditions that are specific to that EA Service.  Your right to use that EA "
"Service is subject to those specific terms and this Terms of Service.  If "
"there are any inconsistencies between the specific terms and these terms, EA "
"will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or "
"more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release "
"for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide "
"to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your "
"experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  "
"This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a "
"Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\""
") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester ("
"\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to "
"you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality "
"Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, "
"a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You "
"understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials "
"provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You "
"agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or "
"reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, "
"(ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary "
"information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure "
"of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and "
"proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and "
"conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-"
"release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above "
"obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in "
"addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief "
"without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your "
"obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will "
"continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the "
"public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you "
"are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-"
"release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you."
"\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of "
"evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, "
"or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges "
"of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  "
"The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" "
"basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience "
"points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be "
"reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the "
"particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history "
"and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) "
"playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may "
"include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you "
"achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no "
"obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any "
"period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be "
"available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at "
"any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the "
"games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you "
"will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above "
"and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Test accounts are non-transferable under any circumstances.\n"
