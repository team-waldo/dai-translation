"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com.\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com.\n"

"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\n"

"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
" - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
" - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
" The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).

If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
" - Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
" - Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"\n"
"B.    How Does EA Collect Non-Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com.\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.

"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or mobile device.

"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services.

To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"
"When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy.

"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service, or we will either block such users from providing personal information, or will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publically available, how we will user the information and other practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"

"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
" - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
" - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
" The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
" - Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
" - Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com.\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.

"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or mobile device. These tools and technologies use server log files, web beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. \n"
"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. \n"

"\n"
"5.    Ad Serving Technology \n"
"\n"
"EA’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help track results.

"\n"
"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third party services in our online and mobile products and services, you acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account (and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products and services and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products and services.  Choose your friends carefully.\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.

"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"
"When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent.\n"
"\n"
"You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.\n"
"\n"
"We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI for more details.\n"
"\n"
"VII.    Where Is The Information Held?\n"
"\n"
"EA is a global organization and the majority of the computer systems on which EA collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives are based in the United States and The Netherlands.

Your personal information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by EA in the United States and in other countries, including countries outside your country of residence both in and outside the European Union and Asia, and used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.\n"
"\n"
"VIII.    How Does EA Protect Your Personal Information?\n"
"\n"
"EA understands the importance of keeping your information safe and secure. EA will make commercially reasonable effort to protect your personal information and ensure the security of our systems.

"\n"
"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service, or we will either block such users from providing personal information, or will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publically available, how we will user the information and other practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about using the Internet safely.\n"
"\n"
"Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child’s information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.\n"
"\n"
"Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites.

"\n"

"\n"
"Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1. Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com.\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as \"local shared objects,\" on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.

"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2. Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3. Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"4. Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"

"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service will either block such users from providing personal information, or we will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publically available, how we will use the information and other practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA's online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"
"\n"
"If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about using the Internet safely.\n"
"\n"
"Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child's information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.\n"
"\n"
"Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user \"profiles\" for public view or in similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted, public information, may be accessed or recorded by EA employees, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there.  \n"
"\n"
"You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

"\n"
"Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.

"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA's last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (\"Disputes\"), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA's (or any of EA's licensors') intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (\"Notice of Dispute\").  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B. Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C. Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D. Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E. Recovery and Attorneys' Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F. Limitation on Arbitrator's Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G. Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"EA collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various online and mobile activities including online and mobile purchases, game registration and marketing surveys, for instance. In addition, we and other third parties use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address.\n"
"\n"
"1.    Cookies\n"
"\n"
"Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements within websites. We may link cookie information to personal information. Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played. This information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage. We and third parties collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad companies, and EA does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so. You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. For more information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com.\n"
" \n"
"We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com.\n"
"\n"
"If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our games, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.

"\n"
"Please note that this privacy policy covers the use of cookies by EA only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\n"
"\n"
"2.    Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels\n"
"\n"
"Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  \n"
"\n"
"We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.\n"
"\n"
"3.    Internet Log Files\n"
"\n"
"EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products. In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers. If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"4.    Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies\n"
"\n"
"EA also uses its own proprietary analytic metrics tool and other third party analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online products and services and/or play our games on your PC, game system and/or mobile device.

"\n"
"The third party analytics companies who collect information on our sites and in the context of our online and mobile products and/or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services.

"By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third party services in our online and mobile products and services, you acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account (and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across EA social platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends’ list may be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products and services and see the profiles you have established.

"\n"
"If you choose to use our referral service to \"Tell a Friend\" about an EA product or site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.

"\n"
"From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to the personal information you provide to us.\n"
"\n"
"When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent.\n"
"\n"
"You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.\n"

Note that certain publically available information you post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI for more details.\n"
"\n"
"VII.    Where Is The Information Held?\n"

"\n"
"X.    A Special Note About Children\n"
"\n"
"Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service, or we will either block such users from providing personal information, or will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publically available, how we will user the information and other practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA’s online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about using the Internet safely.\n"
"\n"
"Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child’s information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.\n"
"\n"
"Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent.\n"
"\n"
"XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, Blogs And Profiles\n"
"\n"
"You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites.

"\n"
"XII.    Third Party Sites.\n"
"\n"
"Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as EA.

"\n"
"XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"

If you are a repeat infringer of EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA determines that UGC violates these terms.

"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"

"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"

"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"

"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester (\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, (ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you.\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"

AAA와 AAA 고객 규정은 AAA 웹사이트인 www.adr.org에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 사용자가 부담할 중재 비용과 중재자 수수료는 AAA 규정에 따르며, 해당 사항이 있는 경우 AAA 고객 규정에 의해 제한될 수 있습니다. 중재자가 이러한 비용이 과도하다고 판단하거나, 사용자가 EA에 중재를 시작하는 데 필요한 비용을 지불할 수 없음을 알리는 분쟁 통지를 상기 분쟁 통지 주소로 전송한다면, EA는 즉시 중재에 따르는 모든 비용을 지불할 것입니다. 중재는 직접 대면, 문서제출, 전화 또는 인터넷을 이용하는 방식으로 실시됩니다. 중재자는 서면으로 판정을 내리며, 한쪽 당사자가 요구할 경우 그 이유를 명시해야 합니다. 중재자는 적용 법률을 따라야 하며, 중재자가 법률을 위반할 경우 중재판정 보상금에 이의를 제기할 수 있습니다. 사용자와 EA는 중재를 집행하고, 계류 중인 중재를 진행하고, 중재자의 보상금 판정을 확정, 수정, 무효화, 실행하기 위해 소송을 제기할 수 있습니다.\n"
"\n"
"c.    제한. 사용자와 EA는 모든 중재가 EA와 사용자 간의 분쟁에만 개별적으로 적용된다는 데 동의합니다. 법률이 허용하는 범위 내에서 최대한 (1) 모든 중재는 다른 중재와 결합할 수 없으며, (2) 어떤 분쟁도 집단 소송에 기초하거나 집단 소송 절차를 이용해 중재될 수 없고, (3) 어떤 분쟁도 일반 대중이나 다른 인물의 대표자를 통해 제기될 수 없습니다. 사용자와 EA는 각각의 개별적인 권능으로 서로에게 배상을 청구할 수 있을 뿐, 집단 소송 및 대표 소송의 원고나 참여자로 청구할 수 없다는 것에 동의합니다. 또한, 사용자와 EA가 동의하지 않는 한, 중재자는 두 사람 이상의 배상을 통합할 수 없으며, 어떠한 집단 소송 또는 대표 소송의 형태도 취할 수 없습니다. 본 특정 약관을 시행할 수 없다고 판정되면, 본 중재 약관 전체가 무효화됩니다.\n"
"\n"
"d.     장소. 사용자가 미합중국 거주자라면, 중재는 사용자가 이용하기 편리한 곳에서 진행됩니다. 미합중국 이외 지역 거주자라면 중재는 미국 캘리포니아 주 캘리포니아 주 산 마테오의 연방법원에서 시작되며, 사용자와 EA는 중재를 집행하고, 계류 중인 중재를 진행하고, 중재자의 보상금 판정을 확정, 수정, 무효화, 실행하기 위해 해당 법원의 속인적 관할권에 따른다는 데 동의합니다.\n"
"\n"
"e.    비용회수와 변호사 수수료. 사용자가 EA에 대해 제기한 청구에 대해 중재자가 사용자에게 유리한 판정을 내리는 경우에 있어 그 판정의 내용이 중재인이 서면 결정을 하기 전에 EA가 마지막으로 서면으로 제시한 합의금보다 더 큰 금액을 보상금으로 결정한 경우, EA는 \n"
"-    $5,000을 넘지 않는 범위 내에서 중재 보상금의 150%를 지불하고,\n"
"-    사용자의 변호사가 있는 경우 변호사에게 수수료를 지불하고 사용자나 사용자의 변호사가 조사, 작성 및 중재 진행을 위해 합리적으로 지출한 모든 비용(전문가 증언 비용 포함)을 변상합니다(\"이하 변호사 프리미엄\").\n"
"중재자는 중재 도중 언제든지, 또는 중재자가 판정을 내리고 14일 내에 한쪽이 요구할 경우 언제든지 수수료, 비용, 대체 지불 및 변호사 프리미엄의 지불과 변상에 대한 결정을 내릴 수 있습니다.\n"
"상기 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리는 해당 법률에 따라 사용자에게 부여되는 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리를 보충합니다. 하지만 중복된 변호사 수수료 및 비용 보상금을 회수할 수는 없습니다. EA는 사용자와 EA 간의 분쟁과 관련된 변호사 수수료 및 비용을 보상받을 권리를 포기합니다.\n"
"\n"
"f.    중재자 권한의 한계.  중재자는 구제를 원하는 개별적인 당사자에 대해서만, 그리고 개인의 배상 청구에서 요구하는 구제를 부여하기 위해 필요한 한도 내에서만 선언적 또는 명령적 구제 판정을 할 수 있습니다.\n"
"\n"
"g.    계약 변경.  본 계약서에 있는 어떠한 약관에도 불구하고, 사용자와 EA는 EA가 본 중재 약관을 변경할 경우 (분쟁 통지 주소 변경은 제외) 사용자가 변경 날짜로부터 30일 이내에 서면 통지를 상기 분쟁 통지 주소로 보내 이러한 변경 내용을 거부할 수 있다는 데 동의합니다. 변경을 거부하면 사용자는 사용자와 EA 간의 분쟁을 본 약관에 따라 중재할 것에 동의하게 됩니다.\n"

"EA는 상업적 목적으로 배포하기에 앞서 프로그램 오류를 발견하고 게임이나 온라인 특성에 대한 의견을 얻기 위해 개인 사용자에게 평가를 요청할 수 있습니다. EA에 의해 평가를 요청받은 개인 사용자는 게임이나 온라인 특성에 대한 개인 의견과 피드백을 오직 EA에게만 제공하여야 하며 이와 같은 과정을 “베타 테스트”라고 합니다. 베타 테스트에 참여하려면 먼저 EA의 발매 전 소프트웨어 비밀유지약정(이하 “비밀유지약정”)에 동의하여야 하며, 비밀유지약정에 동의한 이후에만 베타 테스트에 참여하실 수 있습니다. 베타 테스트에 참여한 개인 사용자는 비밀유지약정을 준수하여야 하며 이에 대한 약관 및 조건은 다음과 같습니다.\n"

You may upload only UGC that you are permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"

You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
" As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services (and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EA, ITS LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING CONDUCT, COMMUNICATION OR CONTENT ON EA SERVICES OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE.

If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i) the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.

"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"

"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester (\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, (ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you.\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"

"b.    구속력 있는 중재. 사용자와 EA가 분쟁 통지 수령 후 30일 내에 비공식 협상을 통해 분쟁을 해결할 수 없다면, 사용자나 EA는 구속력 있는 중재를 통해 분쟁을 최종적이자 독점적으로 해결할 수 있습니다. 한쪽 당사자에 의한 중재 선택은 최종적이며, 다른 당사자를 구속합니다. 사용자는 본 약관에 의해 사용자와 EA는 자신이 법원에 소송을 제기하고 배심원 재판을 받을 권리를 포기한다는 사실을 이해합니다. 중재는 미국중재협회(이하 “AAA“)의 상사 중재 규정 및 소비자 관련 분쟁에 대한 보충 절차(이하 “AAA 고객 규정”)에 의해 개시되고 진행되어야 합니다. AAA와 AAA 고객 규정은 AAA 웹사이트인 www.adr.org에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 사용자가 부담할 중재 비용과 중재자 수수료는 AAA 규정에 따르며, 해당 사항이 있는 경우 AAA 고객 규정에 의해 제한될 수 있습니다. 중재자가 이러한 비용이 과도하다고 판단하거나, 사용자가 EA에 중재를 시작하는 데 필요한 비용을 지불할 수 없음을 알리는 분쟁 통지를 상기 분쟁 통지 주소로 전송한다면, EA는 즉시 중재에 따르는 모든 비용을 지불할 것입니다. 중재는 직접 대면, 문서제출, 전화 또는 인터넷을 이용하는 방식으로 실시됩니다. 중재자는 서면으로 판정을 내리며, 한쪽 당사자가 요구할 경우 그 이유를 명시해야 합니다. 중재자는 적용 법률을 따라야 하며, 중재자가 법률을 위반할 경우 중재판정 보상금에 이의를 제기할 수 있습니다. 사용자와 EA는 중재를 집행하고, 계류 중인 중재를 진행하고, 중재자의 보상금 판정을 확정, 수정, 무효화, 실행하기 위해 소송을 제기할 수 있습니다.\n"

"중재자는 중재 도중 언제든지, 또는 중재자가 판정을 내리고 14일 내에 한쪽이 요구할 경우 언제든지 수수료, 비용, 대체 지불 및 변호사 프리미엄의 지불과 변상에 대한 결정을 내릴 수 있습니다.\n"
"상기 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리는 해당 법률에 따라 사용자에게 부여되는 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리를 보충합니다. 하지만 중복된 변호사 수수료 및 비용 보상금을 회수할 수는 없습니다. EA는 사용자와 EA 간의 분쟁과 관련된 변호사 수수료 및 비용을 보상받을 권리를 포기합니다.\n"

"베타 테스트\n"
"EA는 상업적 목적으로 배포하기에 앞서 프로그램 오류를 발견하고 게임이나 온라인 특성에 대한 의견을 얻기 위해 개인 사용자에게 평가를 요청할 수 있습니다. EA에 의해 평가를 요청받은 개인 사용자는 게임이나 온라인 특성에 대한 개인 의견과 피드백을 오직 EA에게만 제공하여야 하며 이와 같은 과정을 “베타 테스트”라고 합니다. 베타 테스트에 참여하려면 먼저 EA의 발매 전 소프트웨어 비밀유지약정(이하 “비밀유지약정”)에 동의하여야 하며, 비밀유지약정에 동의한 이후에만 베타 테스트에 참여하실 수 있습니다. 베타 테스트에 참여한 개인 사용자는 비밀유지약정을 준수하여야 하며 이에 대한 약관 및 조건은 다음과 같습니다.\n"
"\n"
"EA는 베타 테스터에게 발매 전 게임이나 일부 EA 웹사이트에 접속할 수 있는 권한을 부여합니다. EA가 베타 테스터에게 제공하는 발매 전 게임 및 기타 요소는 모두 EA의 소유이며 이러한 게임 및 기타 요소를 제공받은 베타 테스터는 철저한 기밀을 유지하여야 합니다. 베타 테스터는 (i) 발매 전 게임, 혹은 기밀 사항이나 EA 소유의 정보를 복사하지 않으며 (ii) 발매 전 게임, 혹은 기밀 사항이나 EA 소유의 정보를 안전하게 보관하고 허가받지 않은 개인 및 모든 당사자의 접촉으로부터 철저히 격리시키며 (iii) 비밀유지약정의 모든 약관을 철저히 준수하는 데 동의한 것이 됩니다. \n"
"\n"
"베타 테스터는 사적으로 베타 테스트를 진행하게 되며 본인 외의 다른 누구에게도 발매 전 게임과 게임에 포함된 요소에 대한 접근을 허용해서는 안됩니다. 상기의 약관을 위반했을 경우, EA는 치명적인 피해를 입을 수 있으며 이를 방지하기 위해 EA는 법원으로부터 베타 테스터에 대하여 일방적으로 베타 테스트 금지 가처분명령을 받을 수 있습니다. 베타 테스터와 EA 사이의 비밀유지약정은 EA가 해당 게임이나 요소를 공식적으로 발매하기 전이나 베타 테스터 본인의 잘못이 아닌 이유로 보안에 문제가 생겼을 경우에 유효합니다.\n"
"\n"
"베타 테스터는 EA가 제공하는 모든 발매 전 게임 및 요소와 기밀 사항, 그리고 EA 소유의 정보를 제공받게 됩니다.\n"
"\n"
"베타 테스트의 목적은 발매 전 게임을 평가하고 오류를 찾아내는 것입니다. 본 사이트 및 이곳의 모든 지침은 베타 테스트 대상이 되는 게임상의 모든 콘텐츠와 관련하여 개인에게 일체의 권한이나 특권을 인정하지 않습니다. EA는 베타 테스트 대상 게임을 가능한 범위 내에서 게임 그 자체로 베타 테스터에게 제공하며 그와 관련하여 명시적이든, 묵시적이든 어떠한 보증도 하지 않습니다.\n"
"\n"
"일부 베타 테스트 대상 게임의 경우, 테스트 도중 게임상에서 보물, 경험치, 장비 혹은 기타 아이템을 습득할 수 있습니다. EA는 이러한 데이터를 베타 테스트 기간 중이나 테스트 완료 후 발매 전 사이 어느 시점에서라도 언제든지 초기화할 수 있습니다. EA가 베타 테스트 대상의 게임 데이터를 초기화하면 모든 베타 테스트에 참여한 개인 사용자의 정보 역시 초기화됩니다.\n"
"\n"
"베타 테스트를 시작한 순간, 베타 테스터는 (i)게임 플레이와 관련한 모든 위험은 개인의 책임이며 게임에는 버그가 존재할 수 있고 (ii)베타 테스트 도중 얻은 아이템 및 모든 정보는 언제라도 초기화될 수 있고 (iii)EA는 해당 게임을 무료 이용이 가능하도록 발매하거나 혹은 반드시 발매하여야 할 책임이 없고 (iv)베타 테스트를 종료한 순간 어느 시점에서라도 EA는 해당 게임을 유료 이용만 가능하도록 할 수 있고 (v)베타 테스트 기간에도 EA의 서비스 이용약관은 해당 게임에 유효하며 (vi)클로즈 베타 테스트의 경우, 상기에 명시한 바와 같이 베타 테스터는 게임과 관련한 모든 사항을 기밀로 유지하여야 한다는 조건에 동의한 것이 됩니다.\n"

If you have questions about Account registration, please contact us by visiting help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"To create an Account, you must have an email address, and provide truthful and accurate information.  You must be eligible to use the EA Service for which you are registering.  In addition, some EA Services may require creation of a \"user name\" or a \"persona\" to represent you in game and online.  User names and personas are tied to your Account.  You may not use a user name or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, or otherwise violates the Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"You are solely responsible for all activity on your Account.  Your Account may be terminated if someone else uses it to engage in activity that violates the Terms of Service or is otherwise improper or illegal.  You should not reveal your Account password to others.  EA will not ask you to reveal your password, or initiate contact with you asking for answers to your password security questions.\n"
"\n"
"2. Content\n"
"\n"
"\"Content\" on EA Services includes software, technology, text, forum posts, chat posts, profiles, widgets, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, pictures, video, code, and all audio visual or other material appearing on or emanating to and/or from EA Services, as well as the design and appearance of our websites.  Content includes user-generated Content (\"UGC\").  UGC includes but is not limited to Account personas, forum posts, profile content and any other Content contributed by users to EA Services.  EA Content and UGC collectively shall be referred to as \"Content.\" All Content--with the exception of UGC discussed below in Section 6 and 7--is owned by EA or its affiliates, subsidiaries, licensors or suppliers.  You bear the entire risk of the completeness, accuracy and/or usefulness of UGC found on EA Services. \n"
"\n"
"3. Entitlements\n"

"\n"
"4. Use and Expiration of Content and Entitlements/General License Restrictions \n"
"\n"
"EA grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive license to use Content and Entitlements to which you have access for your personal, private, non-commercial, non-transferable, limited uses solely as set forth herein and as set forth in any additional documentation and/or agreements applicable to the EA Services accessed by you.  Content and Entitlements and all other intellectual property rights in or on EA Services as well as the products and services offered through EA Services, are owned by EA or EA's third party licensors and is protected by United States and International copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and other laws protecting intellectual property and related proprietary rights. You may not copy or download any Content and/or Entitlements from an EA Service unless you are expressly authorized to do so.  In addition, unless expressly authorized by EA, you may not distribute, publicly perform or display, lease, sell, transmit, transfer, publish, edit, copy, create derivative works from, rent, sub-license, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise make unauthorized use of Content or Entitlements.  Any commercial use is prohibited.  You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to Content.  Your rights are subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service as well as any other agreements applicable to the EA Services you are using. \n"
"\n"
"EA reserves all right, title and interest in Content, Entitlements and all associated copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms of Service.  Your permitted use of Content and Entitlements described above is limited by the intellectual property rights of EA and does not include any rights to other patents or intellectual property.  Making unauthorized copies or distribution of Content and/or Entitlements found on EA Services may result in the termination of your Account(s), prohibition on use of EA Services, and further legal action.  Content and/or Entitlement owners may take criminal or civil action against you for unauthorized use of intellectual property. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless EA from any unauthorized or illegal conduct by you, or through the use of your Account, on EA Services.\n"
"\n"
"5. EA Services, Content and Entitlement Availability\n"
"\n"
"Entitlements may only be held in Accounts belonging to legal residents of countries where access to and use of Content and Entitlements is permitted.  Entitlements may be purchased or acquired only from EA or an authorized retailer.  EA reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Entitlements, and EA reserves the right to limit or block any request to acquire Entitlements for any reason.\n"
"\n"
"We do not guarantee that any Content or Entitlement will be available at all times, in all countries and/or geographic locations, or at any given time or that we will continue to offer particular Content or Entitlements for any particular length of time. We reserve the right to change and update Content and Entitlements without notice to you.  Once you have redeemed your Entitlements, that content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Entitlements or for cash, or other goods or services. \n"
"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that you and other users may contribute to EA Services. You are solely responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services (and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"10. Cancellation of your Account\n"
"\n"
"You have the right to cancel your Account or a particular subscription to an EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your Account or applicable subscriptions.  You understand and agree that the cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with EA, including any dispute related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Terms of Service or EA's enforcement or application of this Terms of Service; (2) the Content and Entitlements available through EA Services or any change in Content or Entitlements provided through EA Services; (3) your ability to access and/or use EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon; or (4) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, billing methods, or any change to the fees, applicable taxes, surcharges or billing methods for EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon.\n"
"\n"
"Contact EA's Customer Service Department at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic) to cancel your Account.  EA reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a subscription to an EA Service.  You are also responsible for any amounts owed to third-party vendors or content providers before your cancellation.  Any delinquent or unpaid fees and other unresolved issues with EA Services must be settled before you establish a new Account.\n"
"\n"

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EA, ITS LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT BY THEM OR ANY OTHER PERSON REGARDING CONDUCT, COMMUNICATION OR CONTENT ON EA SERVICES OR USE OF EA SOFTWARE.

You also understand and agree that this Terms of Service, the EA Privacy Policy and the Supplemental Terms incorporated into this Terms of Service, including EA's enforcement of those policies, are not intended to confer, and do not confer, any rights or remedies upon any person.\n"
"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i) the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts.

As noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"
"22. Notice to California Residents \n"
"\n"

Civil Code § 1789.3, please note that (a) EA is located at 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065, (b) The fees and charges for EA Services vary depending on the services selected by you, and (c) If you have a complaint regarding EA Services or desire further information on use of EA Services, visit EA's Customer Support web pages at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).

"\n"
"23. Supplemental Terms\n"
"\n"
"Additional Terms and Conditions for Specific EA Services\n"
"\n"
"Certain EA Services may require you to read and agree to terms and conditions that are specific to that EA Service.  Your right to use that EA Service is subject to those specific terms and this Terms of Service.  If there are any inconsistencies between the specific terms and these terms, EA will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester (\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, (ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you.\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"

You may not use a user name or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, or otherwise violates the Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"You are solely responsible for all activity on your Account.  Your Account may be terminated if someone else uses it to engage in activity that violates the Terms of Service or is otherwise improper or illegal.

"\n"

"\n"
"4. Use and Expiration of Content and Entitlements/General License Restrictions\n"
"\n"
"EA grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive license to use Content and Entitlements to which you have access for your personal, private, non-commercial, non-transferable, limited uses solely as set forth herein and as set forth in any additional documentation and/or agreements applicable to the EA Services accessed by you.  Content and Entitlements and all other intellectual property rights in or on EA Services as well as the products and services offered through EA Services, are owned by EA or EA's third party licensors and is protected by United States and International copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and other laws protecting intellectual property and related proprietary rights. You may not copy or download any Content and/or Entitlements from an EA Service unless you are expressly authorized to do so.  In addition, unless expressly authorized by EA, you may not distribute, publicly perform or display, lease, sell, transmit, transfer, publish, edit, copy, create derivative works from, rent, sub-license, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise make unauthorized use of Content or Entitlements.  Any commercial use is prohibited.  You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to Content.  Your rights are subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service as well as any other agreements applicable to the EA Services you are using.  \n"
"\n"
"EA reserves all right, title and interest in Content, Entitlements and all associated copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms of Service.  Your permitted use of Content and Entitlements described above is limited by the intellectual property rights of EA and does not include any rights to other patents or intellectual property.  Making unauthorized copies or distribution of Content and/or Entitlements found on EA Services may result in the termination of your Account(s), prohibition on use of EA Services, and further legal action.  Content and/or Entitlement owners may take criminal or civil action against you for unauthorized use of intellectual property. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless EA from any unauthorized or illegal conduct by you, or through the use of your Account, on EA Services.\n"
"\n"
"5. EA Services, Content and Entitlement Availability\n"
"\n"
"Entitlements may only be held in Accounts belonging to legal residents of countries where access to and use of Content and Entitlements is permitted.  Entitlements may be purchased or acquired only from EA or an authorized retailer.  EA reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Entitlements, and EA reserves the right to limit or block any request to acquire Entitlements for any reason.  \n"
"\n"
"We do not guarantee that any Content or Entitlement will be available at all times, in all countries and/or geographic locations, or at any given time or that we will continue to offer particular Content or Entitlements for any particular length of time. We reserve the right to change and update Content and Entitlements without notice to you.  Once you have redeemed your Entitlements, that content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Entitlements or for cash, or other goods or services.  \n"
"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that you and other users may contribute to EA Services.  You are solely responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA determines that UGC violates these terms.  The decision to remove UGC or other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others \n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further notice, attribution or compensation to you. \n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services \n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic). \n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  \n"
"\n"
"As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends. \n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services (and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates. \n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"10. Cancellation of your Account\n"
"\n"
"You have the right to cancel your Account or a particular subscription to an EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your Account or applicable subscriptions.  You understand and agree that the cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with EA, including any dispute related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Terms of Service or EA's enforcement or application of this Terms of Service; (2) the Content and Entitlements available through EA Services or any change in Content or Entitlements provided through EA Services; (3) your ability to access and/or use EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon; or (4) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, billing methods, or any change to the fees, applicable taxes, surcharges or billing methods for EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon.\n"
"\n"
"Contact EA's Customer Service Department at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic) to cancel your Account.  EA reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a subscription to an EA Service.  You are also responsible for any amounts owed to third-party vendors or content providers before your cancellation.  Any delinquent or unpaid fees and other unresolved issues with EA Services must be settled before you establish a new Account.\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i) the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.  If you reside in the Republic of Korea: (i) the laws of the Republic of Korea, excluding its conflict of law rules, govern the Terms of Sale; and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating Terms of Sale shall be the Courts of the Republic of Korea, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts.

As noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. \n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; \n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); \n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"  \n"
"- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights; \n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will: \n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and \n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\"). \n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"  \n"
"G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision. \n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"
"22. Notice to California Residents  \n"

"Additional Terms and Conditions for Specific EA Services\n"
"\n"
"Certain EA Services may require you to read and agree to terms and conditions that are specific to that EA Service.  Your right to use that EA Service is subject to those specific terms and this Terms of Service.  If there are any inconsistencies between the specific terms and these terms, EA will be the final and sole arbiter of any such inconsistencies.\n"
"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester (\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, (ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.  \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you.\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"

"Beta Test accounts are non-transferable under any circumstances.\n"

"b.    구속력 있는 중재. 사용자와 EA가 분쟁 통지 수령 후 30일 내에 비공식 협상을 통해 분쟁을 해결할 수 없다면, 사용자나 EA는 구속력 있는 중재를 통해 분쟁을 최종적이자 독점적으로 해결할 수 있습니다. 한쪽 당사자에 의한 중재 선택은 최종적이며, 다른 당사자를 구속합니다. 사용자는 본 약관에 의해 사용자와 EA는 자신이 법원에 소송을 제기하고 배심원 재판을 받을 권리를 포기한다는 사실을 이해합니다. 중재는 미국중재협회(이하 “AAA“)의 상사 중재 규정 및 소비자 관련 분쟁에 대한 보충 절차(이하 “AAA 고객 규정”)에 의해 개시되고 진행되어야 합니다. AAA와 AAA 고객 규정은 AAA 웹사이트인 www.adr.org에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 사용자가 부담할 중재 비용과 중재자 수수료는 AAA 규정에 따르며, 해당 사항이 있는 경우 AAA 고객 규정에 의해 제한될 수 있습니다. 중재자가 이러한 비용이 과도하다고 판단하거나, 사용자가 EA에 중재를 시작하는 데 필요한 비용을 지불할 수 없음을 알리는 분쟁 통지를 상기 분쟁 통지 주소로 전송한다면, EA는 즉시 중재에 따르는 모든 비용을 지불할 것입니다. 중재는 직접 대면, 문서제출, 전화 또는 인터넷을 이용하는 방식으로 실시됩니다. 중재자는 서면으로 판정을 내리며, 한쪽 당사자가 요구할 경우 그 이유를 명시해야 합니다. 중재자는 적용 법률을 따라야 하며, 중재자가 법률을 위반할 경우 중재판정 보상금에 이의를 제기할 수 있습니다. 사용자와 EA는 중재를 집행하고, 계류 중인 중재를 진행하고, 중재자의 보상금 판정을 확정, 수정, 무효화, 실행하기 위해 소송을 제기할 수 있습니다.\n"

"상기 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리는 해당 법률에 따라 사용자에게 부여되는 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리를 보충합니다. 하지만 중복된 변호사 수수료 및 비용 보상금을 회수할 수는 없습니다. EA는 사용자와 EA 간의 분쟁과 관련된 변호사 수수료 및 비용을 보상받을 권리를 포기합니다.\n"

"ELECTRONIC ARTS TERMS OF SERVICE\n"
"\n"
"These Terms of Service and all supplemental terms, as amended from time to time, govern your use of any online or mobile product or service to which you have access, any product or service that requires an Internet connection or Origin Account to access, install or play as well as any Origin Account you use to access online or mobile products or services (\"EA Services\") offered by Electronic Arts or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, \"EA\") for PC, game system or mobile device.  If you reside in the United States, Canada or Japan, these terms are an agreement between you and Electronic Arts Inc.  If you reside in any other country, then these terms are an agreement between you and EA Swiss Sàrl, a company registered in the Geneva Companies Registry with company registration number: CH-660-2328005-8 and with offices at 8 Place du Molard, 1204 Geneva, Switzerland.  If additional terms and/or agreements apply to the EA Service(s) used by you, those additional terms and/or agreements govern your use of EA Services as well.\n"
"\n"
"These Terms of Service, as well as EA’s Privacy Policy available at privacy.ea.com  (incorporated herein by reference) form legally binding contracts between you and EA.  By using EA Services, you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or have reached the age of majority if that is not 18 years of age where you live) or that you have reviewed this Agreement with your parent or guardian and he or she assents to these Terms of Service on your behalf and takes full responsibility for your compliance with them.  You agree that you and/or your parent or guardian are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, representations and responsibilities set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide and comply with these Terms of Service.\n"

Terms for new EA Services are effective immediately upon posting at terms.ea.com.\n"
"\n"

"An Origin Account (formerly known as an EA Account) (\"Account\") may be required to access and use some EA Services.  If you have questions about Account registration, please contact us by visiting help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"To create an Account, you must have an email address, and provide truthful and accurate information.  You must be eligible to use the EA Service for which you are registering.  In addition, some EA Services may require creation of a \"user name\" or a \"persona\" to represent you in game and online.  User names and personas are tied to your Account.  You may not use a user name or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, or otherwise violates the Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"You are solely responsible for all activity on your Account.  Your Account may be terminated if someone else uses it to engage in activity that violates the Terms of Service or is otherwise improper or illegal.  You should not reveal your Account password to others.  EA will not ask you to reveal your password, or initiate contact with you asking for answers to your password security questions.\n"
"\n"
"2. Content\n"
"\n"
"\"Content\" on EA Services includes software, technology, text, forum posts, chat posts, profiles, widgets, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, pictures, video, code, and all audio visual or other material appearing on or emanating to and/or from EA Services, as well as the design and appearance of our websites.  Content includes user-generated Content (\"UGC\").  UGC includes but is not limited to Account personas, forum posts, profile content and any other Content contributed by users to EA Services.  EA Content and UGC collectively shall be referred to as \"Content.\" All Content--with the exception of UGC discussed below in Section 6 and 7--is owned by EA or its affiliates, subsidiaries, licensors or suppliers.  You bear the entire risk of the completeness, accuracy and/or usefulness of UGC found on EA Services. \n"
"\n"
"3. Entitlements\n"
"\n"
"\"Entitlements\" are licensed rights granted, awarded, provided and/or purchased by you to access and/or use online or off-line elements or features of EA Services and/or products.

"\n"
"4. Use and Expiration of Content and Entitlements/General License Restrictions \n"
"\n"
"EA grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive license to use Content and Entitlements to which you have access for your personal, private, non-commercial, non-transferable, limited uses solely as set forth herein and as set forth in any additional documentation and/or agreements applicable to the EA Services accessed by you.  Content and Entitlements and all other intellectual property rights in or on EA Services as well as the products and services offered through EA Services, are owned by EA or EA's third party licensors and is protected by United States and International copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and other laws protecting intellectual property and related proprietary rights. You may not copy or download any Content and/or Entitlements from an EA Service unless you are expressly authorized to do so.  In addition, unless expressly authorized by EA, you may not distribute, publicly perform or display, lease, sell, transmit, transfer, publish, edit, copy, create derivative works from, rent, sub-license, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise make unauthorized use of Content or Entitlements.  Any commercial use is prohibited.  You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to Content.  Your rights are subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service as well as any other agreements applicable to the EA Services you are using. \n"
"\n"
"EA reserves all right, title and interest in Content, Entitlements and all associated copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms of Service.  Your permitted use of Content and Entitlements described above is limited by the intellectual property rights of EA and does not include any rights to other patents or intellectual property.  Making unauthorized copies or distribution of Content and/or Entitlements found on EA Services may result in the termination of your Account(s), prohibition on use of EA Services, and further legal action.  Content and/or Entitlement owners may take criminal or civil action against you for unauthorized use of intellectual property. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless EA from any unauthorized or illegal conduct by you, or through the use of your Account, on EA Services.\n"
"\n"
"5. EA Services, Content and Entitlement Availability\n"
"\n"
"Entitlements may only be held in Accounts belonging to legal residents of countries where access to and use of Content and Entitlements is permitted.  Entitlements may be purchased or acquired only from EA or an authorized retailer.  EA reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Entitlements, and EA reserves the right to limit or block any request to acquire Entitlements for any reason.\n"
"\n"
"We do not guarantee that any Content or Entitlement will be available at all times, in all countries and/or geographic locations, or at any given time or that we will continue to offer particular Content or Entitlements for any particular length of time. We reserve the right to change and update Content and Entitlements without notice to you.  Once you have redeemed your Entitlements, that content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Entitlements or for cash, or other goods or services. \n"
"\n"
"6. Contributing UGC to EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that you and other users may contribute to EA Services. You are solely responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that you post.\n"
"\n"
"EA respects the intellectual property rights of others.  You must have the legal right to upload UGC to EA Services.  You may not upload or post any UGC on EA Services that infringes the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of privacy or right of publicity.  You may upload only UGC that you are permitted to upload by the owner or by law. EA may, without prior notice to you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual property or other rights of a third party.  If you are a repeat infringer of EA's or a third party's intellectual property or other rights, EA may terminate your Account without notice to you.  If your Account(s) are terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and you will lose access to Entitlements associated with your Account.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when EA determines that UGC violates these terms. The decision to remove UGC or other Content at any time is in EA's sole and final discretion. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EA does not assume any responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.\n"
"\n"
"7. UGC License Grant to EA and Others\n"
"\n"
"When you contribute UGC to an EA Service, you expressly grant to EA and its licensors a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable and irrevocable right to quote, re-post, publish, use, adapt, translate, archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, syndicate, license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you or any third party.  You grant EA and its licensors all licenses, consents and clearances to enable EA and its licensors to use such UGC for such purposes.  You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar rights you may have in such UGC.\n"
"\n"
"If the EA Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access and use that UGC as part of the EA Service, then you also grant all other users of the relevant EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further notice, attribution or compensation to you.\n"
"\n"
"8. Paid Services\n"
"\n"
"Some EA Services require payment of a fee.  You must have an Account and pay the subscription or other fees to participate in these activities.  For information about subscription and other fees for particular services, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.\n"
"\n"
"EA reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time.  If you pay a periodic (e.g. monthly) subscription for an EA Service, EA will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least thirty (30) days in advance by posting such changes on the EA Service.  You are responsible for reviewing the EA Service to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the EA Service thirty (30) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but EA will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate fees for any subscription.  If your use of EA Services is subject to use or sales tax, then EA may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"A. Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular EA Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary by EA Service.  When you provide credit card or other payment information to EA, you represent to EA that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method.  By agreeing to this Terms of Service, you have agreed to permit EA to automatically renew your subscription to an EA Service by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to EA.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter for a fee no greater than EA's then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account.  You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify EA if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft).  Changes to such information can be made by contacting Customer Service at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.  EA reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to EA.  Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.  For further information, visit help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends.\n"
"\n"
"B. Trial Subscriptions.  For some EA Services, EA may offer a free trial subscription.  If you accept a free trial subscription, EA will begin to bill your Account for that EA Service when the free trial subscription expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.  You are always responsible for any internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using EA Services, even when we offer a free trial subscription.  Trial subscriptions are not transferrable.\n"
"\n"
"C. Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors.  We may provide links to other web sites.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to EA.  Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with third parties are your responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"9. Termination of EA Services\n"
"\n"
"EA may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or EA Services (and/or any portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such termination within the time period specified when you joined the particular EA Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was specified, then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at EA’s discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product or EA Service or on http://www.ea.com/2/service-updates.\n"
"\n"
"EA may also terminate access to EA Services for violation of this Terms of Service, if EA (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of EA Services renders EA Services less safe for others and/or minors or for illegal or improper use of EA Services, Content, Entitlement, products, or EA's Intellectual Property as determined by EA in its sole discretion.  You may lose your user name and persona as a result of  termination.  If you have more than one (1) Account, EA may terminate all of your Accounts and all related Entitlements.  In response to a violation of these Terms of Service or any other agreement applicable to EA Services accessed by you, EA may issue you a warning, suspend your Account, selectively remove, revoke or garnish Entitlements at an Account and/or device level, immediately terminate any and all Accounts that you have established and/or temporarily or permanently ban your device and/or machine from accessing all EA Services or certain EA Services.  You acknowledge that in such an instance EA is not required to provide you notice before taking action to suspend or terminate your Account, temporarily or permanently banning your device from some or all EA Services or selectively removing, revoking or garnishing Entitlements associated with your Account.  If EA terminates your Account, you may not participate in an EA Service again without EA's express permission.  EA reserves the right to refuse to keep Accounts for, and provide EA Services to, any individual.  You may not allow individuals whose Accounts have been terminated by EA to use your Account.\n"
"\n"
"If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA Services, no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account or the particular EA Service.  If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).\n"
"\n"
"10. Cancellation of your Account\n"
"\n"
"You have the right to cancel your Account or a particular subscription to an EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your Account or applicable subscriptions.  You understand and agree that the cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with EA, including any dispute related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Terms of Service or EA's enforcement or application of this Terms of Service; (2) the Content and Entitlements available through EA Services or any change in Content or Entitlements provided through EA Services; (3) your ability to access and/or use EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon; or (4) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, billing methods, or any change to the fees, applicable taxes, surcharges or billing methods for EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon.\n"
"\n"
"Contact EA's Customer Service Department at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic) to cancel your Account.  EA reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a subscription to an EA Service.  You are also responsible for any amounts owed to third-party vendors or content providers before your cancellation.  Any delinquent or unpaid fees and other unresolved issues with EA Services must be settled before you establish a new Account.\n"
"\n"
"11. Rules of Conduct\n"
"\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"B. Severability.  If any part of this Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of EA, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\n"
"\n"
"C. Waiver.  The failure of EA to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Terms of Service will not constitute waiver of such right or provision.  Any waiver of any provision of this Terms of Service will be effective only if in a writing signed by EA.\n"
"\n"
"D. Governing Law.  If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i) the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Terms of Service and your Account(s); and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with EA or relating in any way to your Account(s) or your use of EA Services resides in the Courts of England and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of England in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving EA or its affiliates, employees, contractors, officers, directors, vendors and content providers.

As noted above, your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, national, and international laws.\n"
"\n"
"20. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below in Section 20.e, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA’s last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.\n"
"\n"
"PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n"
"\n"
"Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic).  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:\n"
"\n"
"- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;\n"
"- claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);\n"
"- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and\n"
"- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n"
"\n"
"The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:\n"
"\n"
" - a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;\n"
"- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;\n"
"- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.\n"
"\n"
"References to \"EA,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.\n"
"\n"
"A.    Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.\n"
"\n"
"B.    Binding Arbitration.  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
"C.    Restrictions.  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n"
"\n"
"D.    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"\n"
" E.    Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:\n"
"\n"
"- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and\n"
"- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").\n"
"\n"
"The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\n"
"\n"
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.\n"
"\n"
"F.    Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n"
"\n"
" G.    Changes to This Provision.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\n"
"\n"
"21. Entire Agreement\n"
"\n"
"The Terms of Service (including the EA Privacy Policy and other Supplemental Terms incorporated by reference into this document) and any posted rules or instructions regarding a particular game, activity, contest, or sweepstakes constitute the entire agreement between you and EA relating to your rights and obligations in the use of EA Services.  If there is any conflict between the Terms of Service and any other rules or instructions posted on an EA Service, EA shall resolve the conflict in its sole discretion.\n"
"\n"
"22. Notice to California Residents \n"

"\n"
"Beta Tests\n"
"\n"
"In its sole discretion, EA may contact you to review and evaluate one or more games, aspects of games, or online features prior to commercial release for the purpose of identifying program errors.  You will be asked to provide to EA (and to EA only) certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the game(s) or site feature(s).  This process is known as a \"Beta Test.\"  You must sign and return to EA a Pre-Release Software Confidentiality Agreement (\"Confidentiality Agreement\") for each specific Beta Test BEFORE you will be allowed to be a tester (\"Tester\") and BEFORE any software will be provided or made accessible to you.  Your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the following terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In connection with the Beta Test, EA may provide you, on a temporary basis, a pre-release copy of a game or access to a feature on the EA site.  You understand and agree that the pre-release copy and all other materials provided to you are confidential or proprietary information of EA.  You agree as a condition of participating in a Beta Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information, (ii) safeguard the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the pre-release copy and confidential and proprietary information, and (iii) fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. \n"
"\n"
"You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to pre-release materials to any other person.  You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to EA, and EA is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations.  Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will continue until EA publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.\n"
"\n"
"Upon request, you agree to immediately return to EA all copies of the pre-release copy and confidential or proprietary information EA provided to you.\n"
"\n"
"As a Tester, you are invited to play beta games for the sole purpose of evaluating the games and identifying errors.  Nothing in these guidelines, or on this site, shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the beta games or content that you find here.  The beta games are provided for testing on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis and we make no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.\n"
"\n"
"When playing some beta games, you may accumulate treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.  This data may be reset at any time during the testing process, and it may be reset when the particular game completes a testing phase.  In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.\n"
"\n"
"By selecting a \"Play\" button to start a beta game, you agree that: (i) playing beta games is at your own risk and you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) EA has no obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) these games may be available only by subscription once the Beta Test process is complete or at any time in the future; (v) EA's Terms of Service apply to your use of the games during the testing phase, and (vi) if it is a closed beta test, you will keep all information about the beta games confidential as stated above and not disclose such information to any other person.\n"

"b.    구속력 있는 중재. 사용자와 EA가 분쟁 통지 수령 후 30일 내에 비공식 협상을 통해 분쟁을 해결할 수 없다면, 사용자나 EA는 구속력 있는 중재를 통해 분쟁을 최종적이자 독점적으로 해결할 수 있습니다. 한쪽 당사자에 의한 중재 선택은 최종적이며, 다른 당사자를 구속합니다. 사용자는 본 약관에 의해 사용자와 EA는 자신이 법원에 소송을 제기하고 배심원 재판을 받을 권리를 포기한다는 사실을 이해합니다. 중재는 미국중재협회(이하 “AAA“)의 상사 중재 규정 및 소비자 관련 분쟁에 대한 보충 절차(이하 “AAA 고객 규정”)에 의해 개시되고 진행되어야 합니다. AAA와 AAA 고객 규정은 AAA 웹사이트인 www.adr.org에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 사용자가 부담할 중재 비용과 중재자 수수료는 AAA 규정에 따르며, 해당 사항이 있는 경우 AAA 고객 규정에 의해 제한될 수 있습니다. 중재자가 이러한 비용이 과도하다고 판단하거나, 사용자가 EA에 중재를 시작하는 데 필요한 비용을 지불할 수 없음을 알리는 분쟁 통지를 상기 분쟁 통지 주소로 전송한다면, EA는 즉시 중재에 따르는 모든 비용을 지불할 것입니다. 중재는 직접 대면, 문서제출, 전화 또는 인터넷을 이용하는 방식으로 실시됩니다. 중재자는 서면으로 판정을 내리며, 한쪽 당사자가 요구할 경우 그 이유를 명시해야 합니다. 중재자는 적용 법률을 따라야 하며, 중재자가 법률을 위반할 경우 중재판정 보상금에 이의를 제기할 수 있습니다. 사용자와 EA는 중재를 집행하고, 계류 중인 중재를 진행하고, 중재자의 보상금 판정을 확정, 수정, 무효화, 실행하기 위해 소송을 제기할 수 있습니다.\n"

"상기 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리는 해당 법률에 따라 사용자에게 부여되는 변호사 수수료 및 비용에 대한 권리를 보충합니다. 하지만 중복된 변호사 수수료 및 비용 보상금을 회수할 수는 없습니다. EA는 사용자와 EA 간의 분쟁과 관련된 변호사 수수료 및 비용을 보상받을 권리를 포기합니다.\n"
