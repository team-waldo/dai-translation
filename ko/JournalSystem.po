"The most unusual part of Orlesian theater, appropriately enough, revolves "
"around our southern neighbor's love of masks. Every actor wears a mask, and "
"every mask follows a hierarchy of shape and colors that indicates to the "
"audience the character's importance. Half-face green masks indicate a "
"leading male role, for example, while half-face purple masks are for primary"
" female characters. Full white masks are reserved for roles of no clear "
"gender, such as spirits, except for demons, whose masks must always be black"
" and red. Further complicating matters for those new to Orlesian theater, an"
" actor's race or sex has no bearing on the parts they can play.   If a "
"director believes they can sell the part, men can play dowagers, women can "
"play dukes, and even an elf can play a king. Once donned, the mask is "
"understood to be absolutely them. None of the actors I spoke to could "
"explain to me the history behind this tradition, but bristled when I "
"suggested other nations find it strange. There is a strong bond of trust "
"between Orlesian theater troupes and their viewers. Indeed, I have rarely "
"attended such attentive audiences than in Val Royeaux. It is my guess that "
"Orlesians, surrounded as they are by masks in their daily lives, both "
"require and fully respect a place where the objects boldly display their "
"wearers' intentions for a change.  An appendix at the back of this volume "

"Once upon a time, we classified these as demons of sloth, but we learned "

"tearing away the foundations of self and purpose. When brought into the "

" He must have been lying low for years.  I compiled everything I had on "
"Thomas Rainier. Read on.  Leliana  {i}What follows is a history of Thomas "
"Rainier, prepared for delivery by Sister Leliana:{/i}  Rainier was born in "
"Markham, a city-state in the Free Marches. There is little information on "
"his early life, but he was already a skilled warrior by the time he turned "
"eighteen. Hoping to make his fortune, he joined the Grand Tourney, that "
"great Marcher contest of arms. He won the melee, proving himself and earning"
" a substantial sum of gold.   What happened to the coin Rainier won in the "
"Tourney is a mystery. Two years later, he appeared in Orlais, no richer than"
" at eighteen. Still, he leveraged his abilities and lingering fame to gain a"
" place in the Orlesian army.   Rainier excelled as a soldier, rising through"
" the ranks quickly to become a captain with a number of men under him. "
"Rainier's men were fiercely loyal. Our sources believe that many would have "
"gladly defied a higher command at his word. On the surface, Rainier "
"safeguarded his men's interests, but further investigation reveals that he "
"was primarily concerned with his own advancement and profit.  Rainier's "
"desire to amass a fortune likely explains his involvement in the massacre of"
" Lord Vincent Callier and his family. Our sources tell us that Rainier was "
"approached by a chevalier: Ser Robert Chapuis. Ser Robert supported Grand "
"Duke Gaspard's claim to the throne and wished to enter into his good graces "
"by eliminating Lord Callier, one of Celene's staunchest allies. Chapuis "
"hired Rainier to assassinate Callier, and offered him a great deal of coin "
"for it. We have no reason to believe his actions were politically motivated."
" In the spring of 9:35, Lord Callier and his family were traveling to their "
"summer home on Lake Celestine when their caravan was ambushed. It is unknown"
" if Rainier realized that Callier would be traveling with his family. Rainer"
" and his men slaughtered Lord Callier and his entourage; they spared not "
"even the children, all four under the age of thirteen.  It seems that none "
"of Rainier's men were aware of the true reasons behind the lord's killing. "
"They simply followed Rainier's orders. Rumors of Rainier's connection to the"
" murders began swirling through the upper ranks of the army, and must have "
"given him forewarning; he was gone when guards came to arrest him. His men, "
"however, were not so lucky. Almost all were charged with treason, save a few"
" who managed to get away.   Thom Rainier was labeled a traitor and a "
"criminal, but remained at large until now."

"The study of the Fade is as old as humankind. For so long as men have "
"dreamed, we have walked its twisting paths, sometimes catching a glimpse of "
"the city at its heart. Always as close as our own thoughts, but impossibly "
"separated from our world.  The Tevinter Imperium once spent vast fortunes of"
" gold, lyrium, and human slaves in an effort to map the terrain of the Fade,"
" an ultimately futile endeavor. Although portions of it belong to powerful "
"spirits, all of the Fade is in constant flux. The Imperium succeeded in "
"finding the disparate and ever-shifting realms of a dozen demon lords, as "
"well as cataloging a few hundred types of spirits, before they were forced "
"to abandon the project.  The relationship of dreamers to the Fade is "
"complex. Even when entering the Fade through the use of lyrium, mortals are "
"not able to control or affect it. The spirits who dwell there, however, can,"
" and as the Chantry teaches us, the great flaw of the spirits is that they "
"have neither imagination nor ambition. They create what they see through "
"their sleeping visitors, building elaborate copies of our cities, people, "
"and events, which, like the reflections in a mirror, ultimately lack context"
" or life of their own. Even the most powerful demons merely plagiarize the "
"worst thoughts and fears of mortals, and build their realms with no other "

"Victory in the Grand Game is not merely determined by what one has at one's "

" of the three sons, however, were born of Andraste. They were born of the "
"Betrayer's concubine, Gilivhan. People choose to overlook the fact that "
"Andraste came from the Alamarri tribesmen and that they were barbarians, not"
" the Fereldans we know today. They were savage warriors who took concubines "
"in addition to their wives, and because Andraste was thought to be too weak "
"to bear children, the Betrayer took Gilivhan to provide him heirs. Which she"
" did. After her death, the sons were raised as Andraste's own.  Later in "
"life, Andraste proved predictions wrong and had two daughters by the "
"Betrayer: Ebris and Vivial. They were kept out of the public eye and not "
"permitted to marry, though both had consorts. Ebris had but one child, Alli "
"Vemar, who perished on a voyage to Denerim—less than a month after her "
"mother fell to plague, and without children of her own. The younger "
"daughter, Vivial, was more controversial: a strong-headed woman who defied "
"her family by falling in love with a mage of Tevinter, Regulan. Vivial and "
"Regulan went into self-imposed exile as the Exalted March began, and into "
"hiding following Andraste's betrayal and murder.  What became of Vivial and "
"her descendants is largely unknown for one primary reason: she had only "
"daughters. Each of those daughters only had daughters. They married into "
"other families and took other names, and in the chaos of the Second Blight, "
"all traces of survivors were lost. Andraste's true bloodline, if it exists, "
"lies solely in the descendants of Vivial, and the suspicion of my order is "
"that it produces only daughters. Thus the claims of your young man, "
"monsieur, are highly suspect.  —From a letter by Sister Galenna of the "
"Augustan Order, Dragon 9:12"

"Even mountains had a heart once. When the world was young, Korth the "

"center of the world, from which he could see all the corners of earth and "
"sky. And he saw strong men become weak, brave men grow cowardly, and wise "
"men turn foolish for love.  Korth devised a plan that he might never be "
"betrayed by his own heart, by taking it out and hiding it where no soul "
"would ever dare search for it. He sealed it inside a golden cask, buried it "
"in the earth, and raised around it the fiercest mountains the world had ever"
" seen, the Frostbacks, to guard it.  But without his heart, the Mountain-"
"Father grew cruel. His chest was filled with bitter mountain winds that "
"shrieked and howled like lost souls. Food lost its flavor, music had no "
"sweetness, and he lost all joy in deeds of valor. He sent avalanches and "
"earthquakes to torment the tribes of men. Gods and men rose against him, "
"calling him a tyrant, but with no heart, Korth could not be slain. Soon "
"there were no heroes left, either among men or gods, who would dare "
"challenge Korth.  The Lady of the Skies sent the best of her children—the "
"swiftest, the cleverest, and strongest fliers—to scour the mountains for the"
" missing heart, and for a year and a day they searched. But sparrow and "
"raven, vulture and eagle, swift and albatross returned to her with nothing."
"  Then the ptarmigan spoke up and offered to find the god-chief's heart. The"
" other birds laughed, for the ptarmigan is a tiny bird, too humble to soar, "
"which spends half its time hopping along the ground. The Lady would not give"
" the little creature her blessing, for the mountains were too fierce even "
"for eagles, but the ptarmigan set out anyway.  The little bird traveled deep"
" into the Frostbacks. When she could not fly, she crawled. She hugged the "
"ground and weathered the worst mountain winds, and so made her lonely way to"
" the valley where the heart beat. With all the god's terrible deeds, the "
"heart was far too heavy for the tiny bird to carry, so she rolled it, little"
" by little, out of the valley and down a cliff, and when the golden cask "
"struck the earth, it shattered. The heart was full almost to bursting, and "
"the pain of it roused the mountain god to come see what had happened.  When "
"Korth neared his heart, it leapt back into his chest, and he was whole "
"again. Then Hakkon Wintersbreath bound Korth's chest with three bands of "
"iron and three bands of ice, so it could never again escape. And all the "
"remaining gods named the ptarmigan honored above even the loftiest eagles.  "

"The Old Gods will call to you, From their ancient prisons they will sing. "
"Dragons with wicked eyes and wicked hearts, On blacken'd wings does deceit "
"take flight, The first of My children, lost to night.  —Canticle of Silence "
"3:6  The Dissonant Canticle of Silence is an alternate creation story to the"
" versions in the Canticle of Threnodies. Much of the canticle is written "
"from the point of view of the Maker Himself as He addresses humankind, which"
" is why it was ultimately considered a blasphemous presumption and removed "
"from the verses of the Chant. Popularly attributed to Archon Hessarian, "
"Silence depicts the Maker as more sorrowful at the corruption and betrayal "
"of His children—both spirit and mortal. He mourns the fall and corruption of"
" the Old Gods as His own mistake, and urges His mortal children to turn "
"aside from the dark path their elder siblings have led them down.  Most "
"historians agree that Archon Hessarian had indeed likely written this "
"canticle during the bloody Tevinter Transfiguration. Literary scholars of "
"the Imperium often cite this as one of the oldest recorded pieces of "
"propaganda. In the sixth verse, the grieving Maker calls upon His mortal "
"children to acknowledge that the dragon gods have manipulated and deceived "
"them, and to throw off their corruptive influence and return to the Light. "
"As the people of Tevinter rose up and slaughtered anyone remaining faithful "
"to their Old Gods, this became the rallying cry of the most terrible "
"bloodbath in the history of the Imperium.  —From {i}The Chant of Light: "

"As to your question regarding why a lion is considered the symbol of Orlais,"
" particularly when the lion is a creature native only to eastern Thedas, the"
" answer is quite simple. It adorns the crest of the Valmonts, the family "
"that has ruled the empire since the end of the Exalted Age, and in truth it "
"is the Valmonts which have come to represent Orlais. Before them, the "
"Orlesian symbol was that of the descendants of Kordillus Drakon: a dragon.  "
"As to why the lion adorns their crest? That dates back to the time of "
"Lambert Valmont, a young captain of Orlais who distinguished himself at the "
"Battle of Ayesleigh, that great and infamous battle that ended the Fourth "
"Blight. It is said that young Valmont disregarded orders during the battle, "
"taking his forces to relieve the beleaguered Antivans and saving them from "
"absolute destruction. Though his superiors were at first chagrined, chalking"
" up the captain's actions to an infatuation with a certain Antivan camp "
"follower (this, incidentally, has never been confirmed), it later came to "
"light that the Antivan force had been led by King Azar Adalberto Campana "
"himself. In the political realignment following the Blight's end, Antiva was"
" an important ally to Orlais—and Lambert Valmont was an Antivan hero. He was"
" given the hand of one of King Azar's daughters in marriage and elevated to "
"noble rank, with a valiant lion to adorn his newly created heraldry. The "
"Orlesian emperor was forced to respond in kind, granting Valmont a "
"marquisate. Imagine, if you will, the hero returning to Val Royeaux from the"
" Blight, sporting a wife with royal blood and the honors of two nations. "
"This is why jealous nobles called him the Swaggering Lion, a nickname he "
"embraced.  It was Lambert Valmont's son, Alphonse, who later led the civil "
"war against the usurper, Xavier Drakon. He killed Xavier in single combat, "
"giving rise to the great Orlesian legend of the Lion Slaying the Dragon, "
"putting an end to the Drakon dynasty as he assumed the throne... and "
"changing the Orlesian symbol forever.  —From a letter by Brother Genitivi to"

"There was once a tiny fishing village on the Waking Sea that was set upon by"
" the Tevinter Imperium, which enslaved the villagers to be sold in the "
"markets of Minrathous, leaving behind only the old and the infirm. One of "
"the captives was the child Andraste.  She was raised in slavery in a foreign"
" land. She escaped, then made the long and treacherous journey back to her "
"homeland alone. She rose from nothing to be the wife of an Alamarri warlord."
"  Each day she sang to the gods, asking them to help her people who remained"
" slaves in Tevinter. The false gods of the mountains and the winds did not "
"answer her, but the true god did.  The Maker spoke. He showed her all the "
"works of His hands: the Fade, the world, and all the creatures therein. He "
"showed her how men had forgotten Him, lavishing devotion upon mute idols and"
" demons, and how He had left them to their fate. But her voice had reached "
"Him, and so captivated Him that He offered her a place at His side, that she"
" might rule all of creation.  But Andraste would not forsake her people.  "
"She begged the Maker to return, to save His children from the cruelty of the"
" Imperium. Reluctantly, the Maker agreed to give man another chance. "
"Andraste went back to her husband, Maferath, and told him all that the Maker"
" had revealed to her. Together, they rallied the Alamarri and marched forth "
"against the mage-lords of the Imperium, and the Maker was with them.  The "
"Maker's sword was creation itself: fire and flood, famine and earthquake. "
"Everywhere they went, Andraste sang to the people of the Maker, and they "
"heard her. The ranks of Andraste's followers grew until they were a vast "
"tide washing over the Imperium. And when Maferath saw that the people loved "
"Andraste and not him, a worm grew within his heart, gnawing upon it.  At "
"last, the armies of Andraste and Maferath stood before the very gates of "
"Minrathous, but Andraste was not with them, for Maferath had schemed in "
"secret to hand Andraste over to the Tevinter. For this, the Archon would "
"give Maferath all the lands to the south of the Waking Sea.  And so, before "
"all the armies of the Alamarri and of Tevinter, Andraste was tied to a stake"
" and burned while her earthly husband turned his armies aside and did "
"nothing, for his heart had been devoured. But as he watched the pyre, the "
"Archon softened. He took pity on Andraste, and drew his sword, and granted "
"her the mercy of a quick death.  The Maker wept for His Beloved, cursed "
"Maferath, cursed mankind for their betrayal, and turned once again from "
"creation, taking only Andraste with Him. And Our Lady sits still at His "
"side, where she still urges Him to take pity on His children.  —From {i}The "

"The criteria the dwarves use to name a Paragon never cease to fascinate me. "
"While a relatively rare distinction, it seems almost any achievement of "
"significance warrants the title. Some Paragons are the victors of great "
"battles. Others write books or songs. The only common thread is an act that "
"betters or sustains the dwarven way of life in some notable fashion.   "
"Aeducan is among the oldest and perhaps most famous Paragons. Not to be "
"confused with his descendent, King Endrin Aeducan, this prior Aeducan was a "
"humble member of the Warrior Caste whose brave leadership during the First "
"Blight saved Orzammar. When other thaigs were lost, Aeducan claimed "
"defeat—but his service made him a hero. History now remembers Aeducan as the"
" quintessential Paragon.   Other Paragons have been more controversial. "
"Caridin, a master smith, created the powerful golems who helped the dwarves "
"immeasurably in their battles with the darkspawn. Caridin then disappeared "
"amid much speculation, taking the secret of his craft with him.   There is "
"also Astyth the Grey, a Paragon of the Warrior Caste. She was famous for her"
" skills in unarmed combat and cut out her own tongue to focus on the art "
"without distraction. An order of female dwarven warriors known as the Silent"
" Sisters persists; they remove their tongues in her honor.   But these are "
"the most well known of the dwarven Paragons. Others have earned the rank "
"over the ages for far less noble pursuits. I've found references to Paragons"
" who made their names writing particularly good rhymes or brewing stronger "
"ales.   Then there's the Paragon named Varen, who separated from his legion "
"and lost his way in the Deep Roads. Varen nearly starved to death before "
"breaking down and eating a nug, believed at the time as appetizing to "

"When the summoning ritual was complete, the spirit appeared. Both spirits "
"and demons have no gender as we understand it, but this one, much like the "
"rare and dangerous desire demon, presented as female. Although its form was "
"not threatening, the spirit carried itself with a confidence, an awareness, "
"I suppose, that I have seen only in the most powerful of demons.  This "
"spirit of wisdom was polite and courteous. It answered our questions about "
"the Fade, even acknowledging the difficulty when we could not understand "
"what it meant. There was none of the bargaining one normally associates with"
" a summoned creature, save that the spirit sometimes asked us questions as "
"well. Heras shared a mathematical formula he had recently proven, while "
"Etrenne explained her study on magical themes in the Chant of Light, and "
"young Rhys talked a little about his mother.  When we were finished, the "
"spirit thanked us for the conversation and then vanished, although none of "
"us had dismissed it. We soon discovered that the summoning ritual we had "
"devised was critically flawed. The spirit had been under no compulsion to "
"come or remain. All the time it had talked with us, it had stayed of its own"
" volition. Heras was greatly concerned that such a powerful spirit remained "
"free, and has updated the ritual to correct for the weakness in the binding "
"enchantment. I understand his caution, but I also confess that I quite "
"enjoyed the conversation. I am not certain the spirit would have talked so "

"They say Ghilan'nain was one of the People, in the days before Arlathan, and"
" the chosen of Andruil the Huntress. She was very beautiful—with hair of "
"snowy white—and as graceful as a gazelle. She kept always to Andruil's Ways,"
" and Andruil favored her above all others.  One day, while hunting in the "
"forest, Ghilan'nain came across a hunter she did not know. At his feet lay a"
" hawk, shot through the heart by an arrow. Ghilan'nain was filled with rage,"
" for the hawk—along with the hare—is an animal much beloved of Andruil. "
"Ghilan'nain demanded that the hunter make an offering to Andruil, in "
"exchange for taking the life of one of her creatures. The hunter refused, "
"and Ghilan'nain called upon the goddess to curse him, so that he could never"
" again hunt and kill a living creature.  Ghilan'nain's curse took hold, and "
"the hunter found that he was unable to hunt. His prey would dart out of "
"sight and his arrows would fly astray. His friends and family began to mock "
"him for his impotence, for what use is a hunter who cannot hunt? Ashamed, "
"the hunter swore he would find Ghilan'nain and repay her for what she had "
"done to him.  He found Ghilan'nain while she was out on a hunt with her "
"sisters, and lured her away from them with lies and false words. He told "
"Ghilan'nain that he had learned his lesson and begged her to come with him, "
"so she could teach him to make a proper offering to Andruil. Moved by his "
"plea, Ghilan'nain followed the hunter, and when they were away from all of "
"her sisters, the hunter turned on Ghilan'nain. He blinded her first, and "
"then bound her as one would bind a kill fresh from the hunt. But because he "
"was cursed, the hunter could not kill her. Instead he left her for dead in "
"the forest.  And Ghilan'nain prayed to the gods for help. She prayed to "
"Elgar'nan for vengeance, to Mother Mythal to protect her, but above all she "
"prayed to Andruil. Andruil sent her hares to Ghilan'nain and they chewed "
"through the ropes that bound her, but Ghilan'nain was still wounded and "
"blind, and could not find her way home. So Andruil turned her into a "

"fuel. Thousands of slaves were sacrificed as we were forced onto the altars "

"the altar or milked of blood without at least some reprimand.   Yet Leonora "
"is missing, and Magister Delphine seems different. She carries an aura she "

"humiliated in a duel of magic. Through my grief I fear, I know, that my "

"Delphine, to demand answers. But such an audience would be a joke to her. No"

"Mages are not demons or monsters. They are men and women like any other, "
"except for their skill with a weapon few are given. I say this to be clear "
"that I do not think all mages should be put to the sword, as some believe. "
"However, every mage walks through life with a blade drawn and ready, whether"
" they wish it or not. Those who insist that mages are harmless must ask how "
"the apostates who fling fire when the templars attack learned how to kill so"
" well. We in the Academie know well that no skill comes without practice.  "
"If you fight a mage, you must close with him, regardless of the danger, or "
"risk being overwhelmed. A mage's strike rarely hits with the force of a "
"trained chevalier's blade, but often carries unnatural energies: fire that "
"boils a man inside his armor, lightning that steals the strength from his "
"limbs, and so forth. To hold back is to give him time to alter the "
"battlefield to his advantage in some fashion, whether he summons a wall of "
"ice, a demonic ally, or magical flames to strengthen the blades of his "
"guards. We know that the warrior who controls the battlefield is most often "
"the victor. You must keep him reacting to you and continue your attack.  "
"Mages rarely wear heavy armor, but their magic can shield them as "
"effectively as our own plate. I have said many times to watch the hips and "
"arms of your opponent instead of the hands, but with the mage, the hands and"
" arms may be your only clue. If his body is protected from your blade, "
"attempt to tangle his arms or bear him to the ground. It is not elegant or "

"It is an old country saying that spindleweed grows best for the sorrowful. "
"Verdant spindleweed in a household's garden has often brought neighbors "

" originates from the plant's use as a seasoning for dishes meant to speed "

"Long ago, when time itself was young, the only things in existence were the "
"sun and the land. The sun, curious about the land, bowed his head close to "
"her body, and Elgar'nan was born in the place where they touched. The sun "
"and the land loved Elgar'nan greatly, for he was beautiful and clever. As a "
"gift to Elgar'nan, the land brought forth great birds and beasts of sky and "
"forest, and all manner of wonderful green things. Elgar'nan loved his "
"mother's gifts and praised them highly and walked amongst them often.  The "
"sun, looking down upon the fruitful land, saw the joy that Elgar'nan took in"
" her works and grew jealous. Out of spite, he shone his face full upon all "
"the creatures the earth had created, and burned them all to ashes. The land "
"cracked and split from bitterness and pain, and cried salt tears for the "
"loss of all she had wrought. The pool of tears cried for the land became the"
" ocean, and the cracks in her body the first rivers and streams.  Elgar'nan "
"was furious at what his father had done and vowed vengeance. He lifted "
"himself into the sky and wrestled the sun, determined to defeat him. They "
"fought for an eternity, and eventually the sun grew weak, while Elgar'nan's "
"rage was unabated. Eventually Elgar'nan threw the sun down from the sky and "
"buried him in a deep abyss created by the land's sorrow. With the sun gone, "
"the world was covered in shadow, and all that remained in the sky were the "
"reminders of Elgar'nan's battle with his father—drops of the sun's "
"lifeblood, which twinkled and shimmered in the darkness.  —From {i}The Tale "

"My dearest Regine:  Surely you must have heard of the Paget's failing "

"Dales. They have to sell it and move to the city. I was called upon to find "

"to protect all people—including mages—from the harmful effects of magic, "
"have instead persecuted mages with such biased judgment as to worsen the "

"relinquish our lives and freedoms under the presumption of guilt for crimes "
"we have not committed.  We condemn those practitioners of magic who, through"
" illness of mind or understandable but misguided anger at those who "
"oppressed them, would use their Maker-given powers to threaten innocent "
"lives, and we pledge to aid any legitimate and impartial government in "
"bringing these lawless {i}apostates{/i} to justice.  We look earnestly to a "
"future of cooperation between all peoples of Thedas, free from persecution "

"As with the stop in the White Rose, the individual tales of the Three "
"Sisters are often told on their own; seldom is the saga repeated in its "
"entirety. Indeed, one of the few times an attempt to do so was as a play in "
"the Grande Royeaux Theater that sharply criticized Divine Justinia's "
"attempts at reform. The play was quickly banned after only three "
"performances. A book titled {i}The Three Brothers{/i} was later published in"
" Minrathous, citing the exploits of three Tevinter brothers who find "
"themselves lost in Val Royeaux and spend their time ridiculing Orlesian "
"culture. Despite claims in Tevinter that it is the original, it's quite "
"clear that the Three Sisters legend far predates it.  Throughout the "
"legend's various incarnations, the most commonly depicted adventures "
"include:  - The sisters are convinced to drink dwarven ale by a handsome "
"nobleman with sinister intentions. Their reactions to the ale vary, but "
"usually by the end of this tale, the sisters end up on a wild chase after "
"the nobleman through the streets of the Belle Marche until he jumps into the"
" river and drowns.  - The sisters ask for help from a group of dwarven "
"merchants, who say they will do so only if the sisters solve a clever "
"riddle. The nature of the riddle varies, but the dwarves always cheat the "
"sisters in the end. Typically, the encounter ends with the sisters fleeing "
"before they are sold into slavery, though sometimes the legend has them "
"clubbing the lead dwarf to death with paddles until the other dwarves run "
"off.  - They are drawn into the annual Satinalia parade, usually in the "
"climax of the story, until the Imperial army descends upon the revelers and "
"starts a chaotic chain reaction that results in the sisters either stowing "
"aboard a pirate ship or wading through the elven alienage's sewers. It seems"
" to change each age.  Once their chaperone, La Bête, catches up with the "
"girls, they usually hang their heads in shame and return to the Montbelliard"
" manse to resume good and honest lives. Not always, however. The most recent"
" versions of the legend have the sisters remaining in Val Royeaux to fight "
"criminals while wearing black masks, though I honestly cannot tell where "
"this comes from.  —From {i}Tales of Val Royeaux{/i} by Lord Werner Jauquin"

"Kordillus Drakon, king of the city-state of Orlais, was a man of uncommon "

"great temple dedicated to the Maker, and declared that by its completion he "
"would not only have united the warring city-states of the south, he would "
"have brought Andrastian belief to the world.  In -3 Ancient, the temple was "
"completed. There, in its heart, Drakon knelt before the eternal flame of "
"Andraste and was crowned ruler of the Empire of Orlais. His first act as "
"emperor: to declare the Chantry as the established Andrastian religion of "
"the empire.  It took three years and several hundred votes before Olessa of "
"Montsimmard was elected to lead the new Chantry. Upon her coronation as "
"Divine, she took the name Justinia, in honor of the disciple who recorded "

"When faced directly, an opponent wearing only light armor and wielding only "

"A warrior wielding a great blade strikes terror into common soldiers, but to"
" a chevalier, he is no greater danger than any other opponent. A skilled "

"first, he is taken unawares in the heat of battle; in the second, he cannot "
"evade the blow because of the nature of the battlefield or his own injuries;"
" and in the third and most common case, he is struck down because he reacts "

" deflect. I have seen men lose their composure due to fear or anger and "
"engage such a warrior directly, thinking they can risk a blow to their body "
"as they would from a light sword or a dagger. In the heat of battle, even "
"the trained mind will think such things. Those who cannot overcome such "
"thoughts die.  You must watch the weapon, but only to gauge its length. "
"Otherwise, as in all fights, the opponent's hips and shoulders will tell his"
" intent. The great weapons are dangerous only when moving or poised overhead"

"he advances but is not truly prepared to strike, you must rush in, cut him, "
"and withdraw to your guard before his blow is ready. It may take ten cuts to"
" kill him. Even after the ninth, he may cleave your head from your body if "
"you do not respect the distance he can cover.  If using such a weapon "
"yourself, mark your distance and do not allow yourself to react to an "
"opponent outside your reach. You cannot recover your guard as quickly as you"
" can with a sword and shield. Keep your weapon moving and measure your "
"blows. A stuttered step on your strike can fool many opponents into thinking"
" you out of range and then rushing their defense. In this manner, you may "

"Thedas is a land of fierce diversity, from the assassin-princes of Antiva to"
" the faded griffons of the Anderfels, but in my travels, I have found one "
"tale that unites the people of this land. It is a story of pride and "
"damnation, and although the telling differs, the essence of the tale remains"
" the same.  At the height of its power, the Tevinter Imperium stretched over"
" much of Thedas, uniting the known world under the rule of the tyrannical "
"magisters. It is said that the Old Gods whom the magisters worshipped gave "
"them the knowledge of blood magic, and the magisters used this forbidden "
"power to cement their rule. The blood of elven slaves and humans alike ran "
"down imperial altars to fuel magister greed, the tales of their excesses so "
"horrifying that one can only be grateful that blood magic is prohibited "
"today.  But all that stands tall must eventually fall. Perhaps they foresaw "
"their ruin, or perhaps their pride knew no bounds, but whatever the reason, "
"the magisters dared to open a magical portal into the Golden City at the "
"heart of the Fade. They sought to usurp the Maker's throne, long left "
"unattended in the Golden City after the Maker turned His back on His "
"creations. They would storm heaven itself with their power and become as "
"gods.  This is what the Chantry, in its oft-exercised tendency to "
"understate, refers to as the second sin.  According to most versions of the "
"tale, the magisters did indeed reach the Golden City and walked into the "
"home of the Maker, where no living being before them had dared, or been "
"able, to tread. But humanity is not meant to walk in heaven. The magisters "
"were wicked with pride and other sins, and their presence tainted the Golden"
" City. What once was a perfect, holy citadel became a twisted home of "
"darkness and nightmares. The magisters were expelled back through their "
"gateway and cursed for their treachery. As the Golden City had been tainted,"
" so were the magisters twisted and transformed into things of darkness—the "
"very first of the darkspawn. The Golden City, once a shining beacon at the "
"heart of the Fade, became the Black City, a reminder of all that man's pride"
" has cost.  —From {i}Tales of the Destruction of Thedas{/i} by Brother "

"Marchellette's odd behavior of late. You see, we recently began the study of"
" history. I thought that it would do the young mistress some good to be "
"exposed to all Thedosian cultures and not just Orlais. It was a foolish "
"thought.   Regrettably, your dear daughter has taken a particular interest "
"in Fereldan folklore. She first developed an affinity for King Calenhad, "
"which seems to have devolved into borderline infatuation. She stared at me, "
"eyes wide, when I told how he unified the barbarians with his allegedly "
"incomparable might and charisma. Every time I tried to move the lesson on to"
" something more important, she insisted I tell her again about Calenhad: how"
" the Fereldans say his hair was twice as yellow as the sun, and his chin "
"more chiseled than the tallest peak in the Frostbacks. Twice now, I've had "
"to tear down drawings she's tacked up in her bedroom of the man shirtless."
"   Then we moved on to the werewolves, which was even worse. As you may "
"already know, the Fereldans venerate the folk heroes Dane and Hafter. Dane "
"was said to have been a werewolf, and Hafter to have descended from one. No "
"enlightened man or woman could ever view such beast people with anything but"
" revulsion. But you know Fereldans and their love of wildlife. "
"Unfortunately, these tales of the wolf men set the little mistress's "
"imagination afire. When she suggested we put on a play for you and her lord "
"father, I could not say no. I'm afraid that's why Marchellette was running "
"through the mansion, wearing wet furs and frightening the chambermaids. She "
"was rehearsing a scene in which Hafter drives back the darkspawn. I've been "
"informed that some priceless family heirlooms were destroyed amidst all that"
" confusion, and I cannot fully express my dismay.   I understand if my "
"abject failure as a tutor results in my immediate dismissal.   —A letter "
"from Brother Bernard to his former employer"

"I have faced Antivan duelists, Fereldan Ash Warriors, and Fog Warrior "
"skirmishers; when we strip away the titles and tricks, they are simply men "
"who want to see their enemies dead, but need a hand free to manage it. "
"Duelists favor a thinner target over the offensive strength of a main "
"gauche. Ash Warriors need a hand to guide their mabari and a lighter weapon "
"to take advantage of the openings their dogs leave, while Fog Warriors rely "
"on stealth and speed too much to use a heavy shield.  When engaging with "
"such an opponent, respect his speed. His hands and feet will move a great "
"deal; ignore them. Watch his hips and shoulders instead. First deny what "
"advantage he has in his allies or environment, unless you have trained "
"equally in such matters. Once you control his weapon, overwhelm him. He has "
"no shield, and you need not fear a second blade.  If forced to fight in such"
" a manner, you must decide whether you will fight as a duelist, one-handed, "
"or as a chevalier. If the former, drop your back leg away to tighten your "
"center target, as you have no shield to cover your body or second weapon to "
"bring into range; focus on a quick attack and give ground freely when you "
"cannot find an advantage. If the latter, rely on your vambrace and gauntlet "
"as a shield, and try to wrench your opponent's weapon away. My left arm "
"bears the scars of such efforts, but my opponents bear worse. Better still: "
"do not lose your shield at all, but battles are not a place of perfection.  "

"A novice believes his sword of the utmost importance, and his shield there "
"to show his family's colors. All scoff at such foolishness, but the older "
"student, thinking his shield a sign from the Maker that he cannot be struck "
"down, is little wiser. A warrior coming away from battle with his shield "
"dented and ripped may be praised for bravery. A warrior coming away with his"
" shield merely scratched should be praised for skill.  Remember that every "
"metal shield was beaten into shape, and may be beaten out of it. Even a blow"
" that does not tear a hole drives impact through your arm and shoulder, "
"where shock and pain will wear down even the strongest warrior. In a duel "
"against a single opponent, you may seek a quick advantage in taking a blow "
"directly to the shield in order to strike one in return; if you are "
"protecting another, you may have no choice. In all other cases—against one "
"opponent or many—it is better to hide the movement of your hips and "
"shoulders behind your shield, forcing enemies to focus on it rather than on "
"you.  This is also true when fighting an opponent so armed. Your goal is not"
" the shield, but the man behind it. Circling or locking shields may gain you"
" an advantageous position. Failing that, rain blows upon his defenses until "
"he tires and his guard grows sloppy. If you are neither skilled enough to "
"slip past him nor fit enough to wear him down, you will most likely die.  "

"height of the Imperium with nothing but dogs and their own obstinate "
"disposition. They are the coarse, willful, dirty, disorganized people who "
"somehow gave rise to our Prophet, ushered in an era of enlightenment, and "
"toppled the greatest empire in history.   There are few things you can "
"assume safely in dealing with these people: First, they value loyalty above "
"all things, beyond wealth, beyond power, beyond reason. Second, although "
"they have nothing in their entire country which you are likely to think at "
"all remarkable, they are extremely proud of their accomplishments. Third, if"
" you insult their dogs, they are likely to declare war. And finally, the "
"surest sign that you have underestimated the Fereldans is that you think you"
" have come to understand them.  —Empress Celene I of Orlais, in a letter to "
"her newly appointed ambassador to Denerim"

"The world during the First Blight was different from the world we know "
"today. Aside from the civilized rule of the Imperium, humans as a race were "
"largely barbarous and splintered, divided into clans and tribes and "
"squabbling amongst ourselves for resources. At the same time, deep beneath "
"Thedas's great mountain ranges spanned a dwarven culture as organized and "
"advanced as ours was primitive.  As the darkspawn bubbled up to the surface "
"from their underground lairs, mankind first buckled and then fought back. "
"The armies of Tevinter attempted to face down the multitudes of twisted "
"creatures and the horrid rotting of the land around them, but they could not"
" be everywhere at once. Human history remembers the First Blight as a time "
"of terrible devastation, and those stories are accurate, but in our "
"arrogance we often forget the price paid by the dwarves in their isolated "
"mountain kingdoms.  The dwarves faced far greater hordes than humanity as "
"the darkspawn challenged them for control of the underground. Despite the "
"might and technology the dwarves brought to bear, the savage darkspawn tore "
"through them, first destroying the more remote thaigs before swallowing up "
"entire kingdoms. Think of it: an entire civilization lost in the space of "
"decades. Compared to the near-genocide that the dwarves faced, what we "
"humans call the First Blight must have seemed a mere skirmish. Against the "
"darkspawn, the dwarven lands have always borne the brunt of the fighting and"
" the majority of the sacrifices.   Four dwarven kingdoms finally managed to "
"combine their might and fight back, and that cooperation saved them. But for"
" the rest of their lands it was too late. The darkspawn had taken the Deep "
"Roads, the majestic underground passages that linked the dwarven lands "
"throughout Thedas. The darkspawn could now attack anywhere on the surface "
"through these tunnels.  Humanity simply was not prepared for such an "
"onslaught. It was clear that the warfare we knew would not avail us. We had "
"to find a new way to fight.  Thus came our salvation: the Grey Wardens were "
"born.  —From {i}Tales of the Destruction of Thedas{/i} by Brother Genitivi, "

"There are many lords and ladies in Val Royeaux.  And I mean this literally. "

"with its own origins and its own nuances of comparison. The Orlesian "
"aristocracy is ancient and much given to competition. All the nobility play "

"Orlesian Empire as it exists now, and who created the Chantry. There is no "
"more venerated figure in Orlais; in Val Royeaux, the statue of Drakon stands"
" as tall as the statue of Andraste. Drakon determined that the Grand Game "
"was tearing Orlais apart, so he abolished all titles besides his own, and "
"lord, and lady.  I am told, with some twittering amusement, that this action"
" did not end the Grand Game as Drakon had intended. Now the lords and ladies"
" collected unofficial titles rather than official ones, such as the exalted "
"patron of Tassus Klay\" or \"uncle to the champion of Tremmes.\" It is a "

"Amrita was a hedge mage, famed for her talent as an herbalist. She could "
"brew philters to soothe every ache or ailment, even coax the ill back from "
"the brink of death. As word of Amrita's talents spread, she was made a "
"target for capture. Amrita fled from them, refusing to go to a Circle. The "
"templars took off in pursuit, dogging her steps, until they came to the edge"
" of the Western Approach. Knowing the templars were less than half a day "
"behind her, Amrita forged ahead. When the templars came to the edge of the "
"desert, they stopped and turned back, believing that Amrita would be doomed "
"to die in that sand-blasted wilderness.  But Amrita did not die. She crossed"
" the wasteland on foot, living off the strange plants that grew there, "
"finding water in roots buried beneath the sand. On that long trek, Amrita "
"discovered the herb now known as Amrita Vein. She brought it out of the "
"desert with her and continued to study and cultivate it. Amrita's extensive "
"writings about desert plants, including Amrita Vein, eventually found their "
"way to the White Spire, where it was decided that her contributions would "
"earn her a degree of freedom. She was allowed to continue living as she "
"desired, as long as she submitted to the Harrowing.  —An excerpt from {i}The"

"The Disciples of Andraste are unique in all of history. The cult preceded "

"Mountains, in a village called Haven, which is now a sanctuary for pilgrims "

"terms.  {i}Debilitating Effects{/i}  Disabled (includes Frozen, Paralyzed, "
"Stunned, and Asleep): The target cannot move or take any action. This effect"
" usually has a limited duration or an action that ends it (taking damage "
"causes a sleeping target to wake up). Note: You can hit disabled targets "
"with abilities marked as detonators to cause devastating combo effects.  "
"Taking Damage over Time (includes Burning, Poisoned, Bleeding): The target "
"takes ongoing damage of a given type over a period of time.  Chilled: The "
"target moves and attacks more slowly.  Confused: The target will attack its "
"own allies.  Knocked Down: The target lies prone on the ground and will "
"require a few moments to get back on its feet.  Panicked: The target stops "
"attacking and moves randomly around the battlefield. Taking damage ends the "
"effect.  Shocked: The target's magical resistance is reduced. It will take "
"bonus damage from magical attacks.  Slowed: The target moves more slowly.  "
"Swarmed: The target is covered in bees. It takes ongoing damage and has a "
"chance to become panicked as a result of the stinging.  Sundered: The "
"target's armor is reduced. It will take bonus damage from physical attacks."
"  Taunted: The target preferentially attacks the character who used the "
"taunting ability to the exclusion of all others, moving to engage them if "
"necessary.  Weakened: The target's attacks do less damage.  Vulnerable "
"(type): The target will take bonus damage from attacks of this type (such as"
" fire, cold, or spirit).  {i}Beneficial Effects{/i}  Barrier: A magical "
"effect that protects the target from damage. Incoming attacks must deplete "
"the barrier before the target loses health. Some abilities, spells, and "
"weapons do bonus damage against a target's barrier.  Guard: A type of combat"
" training that protects the target from damage. Incoming attacks must "
"deplete the guard before the target loses health. Some abilities, spells, "
"and weapons do bonus damage against a target's guard. A target with an "
"active guard resists being staggered or knocked down.  Resistance (type): "
"The target takes less damage from attacks of this type of damage (such as "
"fire, cold, or spirit).  Greater Resistance (type): The target takes little "
"or no damage from attacks of this type, rendering it almost completely "
"ineffective.  Immunity (effect): The target is completely immune to one or "
"more debilitating effects (such as Burning or Asleep).  "

"Lords and ladies of the Magisterium, before we vote on the budget for this "

"To fight an enemy with a bow or crossbow is simple, although not always "
"easy.  A guard with a crossbow must crank his weapon after each shot. If "
"there is only one such enemy, seek cover and give him cause to waste his "
"shot, and then close upon him before he may fire again. If there are many, "
"close to their flank so you face one guard directly, using him as a second "

" move to the middle of their ranks and rely upon them hesitating to risk "
"hitting one another.  A soldier with a shortbow is a little more dangerous. "
"Attack him as you would an enemy with a crossbow, but accept that he will "
"likely fire again. Approach with your shield up, even if you must sacrifice "
"speed. Few soldiers are true masters of the bow; those who do not fumble "
"their draw in fear will fire a shot quickly, so it is more likely to glance "
"off your armor or shield than punch through.  Few soldiers have the skill or"
" strength to make good use of a longbow. Respect those who do. Against such "
"an enemy, cover is the only defense. Move quickly across his field of "
"vision, forcing him to compensate for your movement. Do not charge directly "
"unless your allies can distract him. A fully drawn longbow can drive an "
"arrow through a chevalier's plate at a hundred yards.  A fight between an "
"archer and a chevalier is a test of cunning versus patience. We are too "
"often patient—heavily armored as we are—and faced with lightly armored foes "
"who would harass us. While archers frustrate me as they do most chevaliers, "

"There are those who believe the tale that Antiva owes its independence to "
"the looming threat of the Crows. Yet this story—largely spread by the Crows "
"themselves—is no more credible than the promises of a market-stall huckster."
" For the truth of the matter, we look instead to the Palace of the Kings in "
"Antiva City. A grand statue of a woman in Rivaini royal garb towers over the"
" entrance, her watchful eyes keeping sight of everything happening within "
"those walls: Asha Subira Bahadur Campana, Queen Mother of Thedas.  When the "
"matriarchs of Rivain arranged the marriage of Princess Asha of Ayesleigh to "
"King Alonzo Campana of Antiva, it went unnoticed and unremarked by their "
"contemporaries; the eyes of Thedas were on the wars of Orlais and Nevarra. "
"The marriage of a minor princess of Rivain to an almost powerless king was "
"beneath their consideration. Yet this wedding was, in retrospect, perhaps "
"the most important event in Thedas's history since the blackening of the "
"Golden City.  Queen Asha was a skilled tactician; seeing the military "
"ambitions of Tevinter, Nevarra, and Orlais, she concocted a plan. Antiva was"
" too prosperous to escape its neighbors' avarice, yet had no means of "
"raising an army capable of fending off both Tevinter and Orlais without "
"impoverishing the kingdom. If she was to safeguard her people, it must be "
"through measures stronger than steel.  The queen spent decades making "
"alliances in the ancient Rivaini way: marriage. She wed her many children "
"and grandchildren strategically into nobles houses across the continent. "
"Within thirty years, Antiva was so well-connected that any hostile action "
"against it would force half the nations of Thedas into war.  The blood of "
"Queen Asha runs in the veins of the Empress of Orlais, the Prince of "
"Starkhaven, the King of Nevarra, and seven of the Dukes of the Anderfels; "
"even some magisters of the Tevinter Imperium have ties to the Antivan royal "
"family. Asha's web of blood ties forces most of the continent to remain at "
"peace with Antiva, or risk terrible consequences at family dinners.  —From "

"My friends, we accept as fact that more powerful and intelligent demons "
"select more complex aspects of our reality to observe and interact with. A "

"bloodthirsty arrogance of soldiers, or sadly, the blind confidence of mages."
" A demon of desire may focus on lust, greed, or even the desperate wishes of"

"Blight not weakened it, the Tevinter Imperium would have crushed Andraste's "

"yes, but both have found respect and fascination in cultures across Thedas. "
"Only the Blight is an unadulterated source of horror. If there exists a "
"demon of fear who has shaped itself into a more intelligent, more specific "
"mold, it will be a demon focusing on fear of the Blight.  This is the "
"experiment I undertake. By the time you read this, my friends, I will be "

"The Empty Ones were a small and short-lived cult based in Nevarra and known "

" a deep despair. They believed that the Prophet's betrayal and execution "

"would soon come upon them. The most fatalistic of them all gathered together"
" to prepare for their doom. They called themselves the Empty Ones, for they "

"hand.  It is unknown what passed then, but over time, the Empty Ones grew to"
" believe that the blight was to be the tool by with the Maker would end all "
"of creation. They preached that it came from the Void, a place of nothing, "
"and that returning to the Void was something to be celebrated because it "
"meant an end to all pain and all suffering.   Some mistakenly take this to "
"mean that the Empty Ones worshipped evil, but that is an oversimplification."
" The Empty Ones believed the world to be beyond redemption, and that it was "

"Not many people take the road west into Perendale for the sake of pleasure. "
"Few living things inhabit the rocky countryside save for silver miners, "
"wyverns, and an astoundingly pugnacious breed of mountain goat. In far-off "
"days, the mountains around the city were full of dragons, and perhaps this "
"was what first brought it to the attention of the Pentaghast kings.  "
"Certainly, it was not the goats.  Although the region has belonged to "
"Nevarra since the late Blessed Age, travelers here will find much that "
"reminds them of a provincial Orlesian town. A great carving depicting the "
"Lions Slaying the Dragon adorns Perendale's gate, and many Orlesian lions "
"decorate the city's buildings. And there are still many citizens who cling "
"to the hope that the empress will restore the city to the empire. Historians"
" mostly agree that it was not the dragons, nor the silver, and certainly not"
" the goats that began centuries of warfare between Orlais and Nevarra. It "
"was Emperor Etienne Valmont and the Pentaghasts.  In 7:82 Storm, the "
"Pentaghast family, fresh on the throne again for the first time in "
"generations and eager to build up the alliances lost by the Van Markham "
"dynasty, approached the emperor to solidify a peace treaty through marriage."
" The emperor, who was under great pressure to produce an heir, set aside his"
" empress of 17 years and wed Princess Sotiria Pentaghast, theoretically "
"cementing a promise of peace and cooperation between Nevarra and Orlais.  "
"Promises are hard to keep. By 7:97 Storm Sotiria was still childless, and "
"the emperor sent her to a cloister so that he might marry his mistress. As "
"anyone other than Etienne might have predicted, the Nevarrans took this "
"poorly. Angry letters arrived in the Imperial Palace by the cartload. A "
"small war party of Pentaghasts rode into Orlais and reclaimed Princess "
"Sotiria. But the Nevarrans did not take military action yet. They were "
"strategists, and knew to bide their time.  In 8:46 Blessed, while most of "
"the Orlesian army was committed to a war in Ferelden, the Pentaghasts began "
"their war against Orlais. The Orlesians rallied a defense and drove the "
"Nevarrans from Ghislain and Arlesans, but at the cost of much of their "
"northern territory. Perendale was lost and never recovered. A lingering sign"
" that peace between the two nations was impossible.  —From {i}In Pursuit of "
