"In a hold past our own, there were two men. One was born Ivatt Jovsen, the "
"other Rekkas Hildsen. When word came lowlanders marched on Ivatt's hold, he "
"searched for them. He found the lowlanders in a valley, and his heart was "
"grieved, for they wore mail, and spoke eagerly of battling Avvar, and came "
"in great numbers. But clever Ivatt studied the rock above the lowlanders. "
"When they camped for the night, he climbed up to the tallest peak, and "
"rolled a great boulder to the edge, aiming for the light of their fires. The"
" boulder slid with other rocks into a mighty wave of dirt and stone. More "
"than half their number were crushed, and the others fled in terror back to "
"the lowlands.  Ivatt's hold held a great feast to celebrate and said the "
"songs would now call him Ivatt Stone-Thunder. Rekkas Hildsen grew jealous. "
"Did he not shoot better than Ivatt? Did he not run faster than Ivatt? A "
"great monster lived at the top of the mountain by the hold. It had feathers "
"of gold, and taloned claws, and stole their game from the valley. Rekkas "
"swore he would kill the beast to make his own legend-mark and went hunting "
"on the mountain.   The first night, Rekkas found and killed a ram. The "
"second night, Rekkas found and killed a hart. The third night, Rekkas found "
"the nest of the feathered monster, and it was empty. The hunter laid the "
"hart and the ram on the nest, then climbed above it. When dawn broke, the "
"monster returned. It greedily tore open the meat. While it was distracted, "
"Rekkas leapt down and plunged his sword into its back.  The monster "
"screamed, but its hide was thick, and the sword stuck. The beast took off "
"into the sky with the terrified Rekkas still on its back. The monster "
"twisted and looped to shake him off, and the sword dropped into the deep "
"valley. Desperate, Rekkas held on to the feathers on the monster's neck. He "
"saw the beast would soon fly over his home, where all his friends and kin "
"were gathered in astonishment at the sight above them. Rekkas threw his "
"weight, trying to force the monster closer to the ground. It worked, and "
"when the beast soared over the hold, Rekkas twisted and threw himself off. "
"The gods were kind, and as the beast flew off, Rekkas landed on a midden "
"heap, torn feathers floating about him.   Rekkas was humble the rest of his "
"days, never again letting jealousy take his head. The hunter knew, in the "
"end, his legend-mark could have been far worse than Rekkas Feather-Fall.\"  "

"The Qun teaches that all living things have a place and a purpose, and only "

"the self is, therefore, the first and greatest duty.  Those born with magic "
"are at a terrible disadvantage, for demons can always rob them of their "
"self. Because of this, the Qunari name them saarebas, meaning âdangerous "
"thing,â and treat them with the utmost caution. Saarebas must be carefully "
"controlled by someone else, an arvaarad, âone who holds back evil,â because "
"they cannot truly control themselves. The evil is not the mage, but the loss"
" of the mage, the loss of the mageâs self, and the suffering that inevitably"
" follows.  The Qunari pity and honor the saarebas, for striving while under "
"constant threat from within is truly selfless, which is the highest virtue "

"the land.  Others have voiced concern over the specimen. The Qun does not "

"Veil, which protects us from the Fade. This Veil stripped power from his "
"rulers, who had treated their people with such excess that it makes the "
"southern kings and queens seem staid.   Thus does every action carry "
"rightness and all paths converge.   In his greatest magic, the elven mage "
"became an agent of peace through the Veil. In our willingness to brave this "

"words of Ashkaari Koslun:  Existence is a choice. There is no chaos in the "
"world, only complexity. Knowledge of the complex is wisdom. From wisdom of "
"the world comes wisdom of the self. Mastery of the self is mastery of the "
"world. Loss of the self is the source of suffering. Suffering is a choice, "
"and we can refuse it. It is in our own power to create the world, or destroy"
" it.   For peace, we will endure any horror here. We will create a safer "

"{i}Correspondence between Shaper Valta and Shaper Czibor:{/i}  Shaper Valta:"
"  Tread carefully. The evidence regarding your theory about the Titans is "
"copper-plated. King Harrowmont and the Assembly will not take kindly to "
"untraditional and, dare I say, radical ideas. Especially as food riots "
"persist. It's times like these when we must stand together and hold on to "
"traditionâthe foundations of what makes us dwarves. Our king has followed "
"this example. So should you.  Shaper Czibor  {linebreak}  Lord Shaper "
"Czibor:  While I admit the weight of my evidence is light, the fact that it "
"exists must lend some credence to my theory. I'm not advocating that the "
"Titans be added to the Memories this instant, only that they be considered. "
"I have faith that once Inquisitor {spHeroLastName} arrives, we will find "
"more evidence to support my claim.  As for King Harrowmont, may I remind you"
" that the Shaperate is meant to be an institution unaffected by politics. "
"The Noble Caste has benefited greatly from our king's policies, but he is "
"far from Paragon material. There are still those who question his validity "
"as king, as it was the influence of a Grey Warden that placed him on the "
"throne.   Forgive my candor, but I write this to you as a friend.  Shaper "
"Valta  {linebreak}  Valta:  I see the Deep Roads has not dulled your spirit."
" For both our sakes, this correspondence will remain between us.  Shaper "

"Kings cannot choose their legacy, only steer the tide of public opinion and "
"hope that history is kind. It so rarely is. As the youngest child of King "
"Endrin Aeducan, Prince Bhelen was never meant to rule. That honor belonged "
"to Trian, eldest heir to House Aeducan. Trian's murder fractured Orzammar's "
"once-stable foundations and created a sickness within the noble walls of the"
" palaceâone that drove Endrin to his death. In the wake of this tragedy, "
"Bhelen pushed aside his own grief to claim a throne for which he never "
"askedâall to stop a wraith-blooded ally who saw the king's death as an "
"opportunity to rise above his station. Indeed, if not for the Hero of "
"Ferelden, House Aeducan may have become a thing for the Memories. Since "
"taking the throne, King Bhelen has made it clear that his greatest concern "
"is the future of the dwarven people. Will our king be remembered for his "
"tolerance? For his progressive thinking? Or perhaps Bhelen Aeducan's reign "
"will be forever overshadowed by his rocky ascension to the throne, as the "
