"The fog came on swiftly, cloaking the world in shadow and turning the stones beneath our feet into a treacherous slick. I knew we had to find shelter before we lost even that faint light. We stumbled on, following Ragnarr's broad painted back, and arrived at an ancient Tevinter temple just as the last of daylight left us. Ragnarr instructed us to pitch our shelters beneath the entrance passageway and warned us not to wander too deep into the ruin. His voice was an uneasy whisper, and I knew at once that he was afraid. Wary of alarming the rest of our expedition, I took Ragnarr aside and spoke to him. Some of the Avvar, he said, believed the temple to be the haunt of old, vengeful spirits. The Tevinter had come here long ago and built their great temples and then one day, without warning, they had abandoned them all. Ragnarr was convinced that they had done something terrible here, though he could not tell me what it was. Whatever the reason, he found the temple deeply disturbing and had brought us to it only out of desperation. \n"

These scholars claim the poem's title was a later addition, meant to discredit the last Inquisitor's reputation. The poem was later deemed \"problematic\" and relegated to a list of banned works.\n"

"Known as \"the Watchful Eye\" in common parlance, this constellation had great significance to the ancient Alamarri and Cirianne peoples of southern Thedas. The story goes that the Lady of the Skies opened one eye so that the light from her gaze could lead her people safely from the Frostbacks. When Andraste's armies marched north from their ancestral lands to wage war upon Tevinter, they were guided by the Eye, and it became the Maker's gaze—not the Lady's—leading them to victory. The sword was added later; it is said that the star that marks the point of its blade only appeared in the night sky after Andraste's death. The early Inquisition took Visus as the symbol of their holy calling when they joined the Andrastian faith: the Eye representing both their search for maleficarum and the Maker's judgment upon their actions. When the Inquisition ended and became the Seekers of Truth and the Templar Order, the templars took the sword while the Seekers retained the Eye.\n"

I asked Halvor where he'd last traveled, and he said he'd been trading with an Avvar hold in Frostback Basin. Then he raised an eyebrow at the look on my face. So I described the stories Uncle told us as children, where brave expeditions get lost in places like the Western Approach, Nahashin Marshes... Frostback Basin. He laughed and admitted it could be a cruel place. He described thick forests—greater than any I've seen, I'm certain—and darkened swamps. His rule for traveling there seemed to boil down to \"be wary and alert... because everything can kill you.\" The wildlife is violent, the cliffs are steep, and you must be mindful of the gods' wishes (here meaning his Avvar gods). Of course, the hunting's good, the trade fair, and the Avvar hold impressive.\n"

"It starts with a man: Ivar Jerriksen. \n"
"\n"
"Driven from their hold by war and misfortune, their thane dead, Ivar led what remained of his people through the mountains. The winter was harsh. The winds of Hakkon echoed through the peaks. The beasts fled, and the hunters could find little game. Ivar's people grew weak. They feared themselves cursed. When the blizzard struck, they built a meager fire and huddled for warmth. When the blizzard lasted three days, they knew that they would die.\n"
"\n"
"On the third night, while Ivar stood watch, he caught sight of a great grey bear through the snow. Though the beast was distant, Ivar could feel its eyes upon him and knew he must follow. Alone, he made his way through wind and snow. The great bear walked ahead of him, always distant but never out of sight.\n"
"\n"
"At last, the bear stopped. Ivar came to stand beside the bear and saw before him a sheltered place where his people might be saved. He reached out a hand to his guide, but instead of fur, he found grey stone. So Ivar knelt before the stone and gave thanks to Korth, for he knew the Mountain-Father had taken the form of a bear to guide him here.\n"
"\n"
"Ivar returned to his people and led them to the sheltered place. Ivar Jerriksen became Ivar Snow-Favored, and the people swore to honor him as their new thane. The hold was given the name Stone-Bear in honor of Ivar's vision, and in this place, we have grown strong.\n"

"What is thrown into the Avvar's cookpots? What isn't! Far from the delicate creams and sauces of Val Royeaux, or the rich pies and ripe cheeses beloved in Ferelden, the Avvar must subsist on whatever their mountain valleys provide. Nothing is too humble for their appetites, from the small, succulent snails found on hillside boulders to fern fiddleheads harvested in the spring. This is not to say the Avvar do not dine on more dangerous (but far more filling) fare. Harts, rams, gurguts, and lurkers are all candidates for communal evening meals taken around the fire. \"Lowlander\" spices, while not unknown, are great delicacies reserved for feasts. (In fact, my parting gift to the thane of Fennec-Tooth Hold was, at his request, ten jars each of black peppercorns, powdered mustard, and Antivan cord-seed.)\n"
"\n"
"Avvar cooking methods favor utility. Stews are common because they can be simmered until nightfall with small fuss. Holds by lakes or rivers will wrap fish in clay and pungent leaves and leave it to bake all day over banked coals. Most Avvar food preparation, however, centers around winter. From the spring thaw onward, the hold is an endless hive of activity as meat is smoked, vegetables are pickled, and fruits are dried and stacked in crude dirt cellars in preparation for the long dark. \n"
"\n"
"Despite this race against the seasons, the Avvar freely leave out rich cuts of meat and piles of plump berries on wood and stone slabs around their village. They believe these \"offerings\" propitiate a strange collection of beings they refer to as \"gods\" inhabiting the forest. The wise traveler attempts not to judge, and I was treated with all care due a guest, but I never become accustomed to the sight of good food left out by such a practical people.\n"

"What is known about Inquisitor Ameridan would barely fill a page. He was a friend of Emperor Drakon. He was Inquisitor when the Seekers of Truth folded themselves into the Chantry as part of the Nevarran Accord, their Order serving as precursor to the Order of Templars and the Circle of Magi. Shortly after the accord was signed, between 1:22 and 1:24 Divine, Ameridan left his position and departed, never to be seen again.\n"
"\n"
"These facts alone are undisputed. Everything else is uncorroborated hearsay, broad speculation, or salacious rumormongering:\n"
"\n"
"—Ameridan did not willingly cede power. Drakon forced the Seekers of Truth to disband upon pain of death, then removed the Inquisitor rather than suffer rebellion in the new Chantry's ranks.\n"
"\n"
"—Ameridan was forced to retire due to the still-young Chantry's restrictions requiring celibacy, as he was involved in a relationship with a mysterious \"lady-mage\" that the Chantry erased from history.\n"
"\n"
"—Ameridan was a rowdy noble who cared more for raucous entertainment than for the Seekers. He held the position only because Drakon wanted a loyal friend commanding the Order, and when the Seekers became part of the Chantry, Ameridan was free to retire to a life of hunting dragons and wenching.\n"
"\n"
"Any of these stories may be true, and without more evidence, we have little hope of ever reaching a clear determination. Nevertheless, I would offer a few notes that are often overlooked as scholars delve so deeply into their own historical specialties as to lose key context:\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, Emperor Drakon, rightly acknowledged as the man who molded the Chantry into the organization it is today, was a pious man, committed to spreading the Chant of Light and creating a world where magic and men were governed by Andrastian principles. All sources agree that Ameridan was a close friend of Drakon, and while it is certainly possible that Ameridan was more pragmatic than pious, it is {i}highly unlikely{/i} that Drakon would have befriended a figure who was actively {i}opposed{/i} to the Chantry, much less tolerated such a man holding a position of power in the growing Orlesian Empire.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, Inquisitor Ameridan was universally acclaimed as a powerful combatant, regardless of his supposed faith (or lack thereof). Rumormongers suggesting Ameridan was exiled ask us to believe that Emperor Drakon could see no use for a powerful warrior with years of command experience. Given that the Second Blight had been a fact of Orlesian life for more than 15 years at the time of Ameridan's disappearance, with darkspawn pouring from the Anderfels into northern Orlais in growing numbers, it is {i}frankly absurd{/i} to suggest Drakon would casually dispose of such a military asset.\n"
"\n"
"Without further evidence, we may never know more about Ameridan's departure. Nevertheless, I hope that we may eschew the currently popular cynicism, at least when obvious evidence against it is presented, to see that his disappearance must have had some other cause.\n"

"In a hold past our own, a man named Virmik Torsen was to wed a woman named Seddra Yildsdotten. They were young, and in love, and made large offerings to the gods asking for happiness. The night before their wedding, Seddra had a dream. The Lady of the Skies came to her and told her to tie her rope-knots so tightly that she and Torsen would only wed a year. She awoke troubled, but did as the Lady asked. Virmik untied only one knot, and they married a year.\n"
"\n"
"The year was hard. Their bows missed game and the winter wind howled through their huts. Virmik and Seddra grew thinner. When the marriage was up, they made large offerings to the gods, this time asking for mercy. The night before the wedding, the Lady of the Skies came to Virmik in a dream and told him to untie a single knot, so he and Seddra would wed only a year. Virmik awoke sorrowing, but did as the Lady asked. He and Seddra married again for a year.\n"
"\n"
"The year was long. The weather was foul and the crops were poor. Virmik and Seddra grew thinner still. When their marriage time was up, Seddra and Virmik both had a dream from the Lady of the Skies. \"You asked for happiness,\" she said, \"but I cannot give that to you. You asked for mercy, but the land will not show it. Think carefully what you ask tomorrow.\"\n"
"\n"
"Seddra and Virmik spoke long into the night and in the morning made an offering to the gods. They asked for strength to hunt and harvest when life was good, and patience, when life was not. The year was good in some places and hard in others, but they grew to know themselves and what they could bear. They became happy, not from the gift of the gods, but from their own deeds, and lived the rest of their lives as one.\n"

"Some outlying nations have differing ideas on what happens to us after death. The southern Avvar, for example, believe in a hazily defined afterlife governed by \"the Lady of the Skies\" where the dead are reunited with their kin. A comforting notion, and not unfamiliar. The Chantry's idea that on death we cross the Fade to live by the Maker's side is accepted from rough Ferelden to decadent Tevinter. Yet Avvar also believe some of their people are destined to be \"reborn,\" which some among the Chantry have great trouble grasping. It is not, I must emphasize, a spirit possessing a body. Other than invoking the gods, spirits have nothing to do with the process. It is the essence, the soul, which returns clothed in new flesh.\n"
"\n"
"The core of the concept is thus: the souls of a few Avvar \"favored\" by fate \"migrate\" on death to inhabit a new body destined for them, so they may return and perform great deeds for the good of their hold. These resurrected souls are not expected to remember their past selves consciously, but instead are assumed to be subtly \"guided\" by their previous experiences, especially through visions and portents. This most conveniently sidesteps the need for proof that one has been \"reborn\" or that such things even occur. Then again, perhaps we should not cast scorn too quickly; as of yet, not one of the dead has returned from across the Fade to describe the Maker's paradise.\n"

"I argued with the Avvar mage long into the night. If we'd had no truce with these barbarians to fight the darkspawn, it would have come to blows. Their conception of the Maker is as a child's! They assume He is a \"spirit,\" and that we have displeased Him because He \"answers none of your prayers.\" When I attempted to explain the doctrine of the Chant, the mage kept asking nonsense such as \"Did Andraste have no gods of her own?\" or \"Why haven't you sung up another Maker?\" I asked what in the good grace of Thedas she was on about, and the answers chilled me.\n"
"\n"
"The Avvar confuse spirits for \"gods,\" treating them as patrons to be lulled and wooed. The mage described, to my growing horror, how the Avvar deliberately invoke spirits for \"strength in battle\" or solicit them for advice. The mage claimed some of the spirits around her village had \"lived\" with her hold for a dozen generations, and sometimes took on the form of an animal or departed relatives \"when they pass on their wisdom.\"\n"
"\n"
"Strangest of all, in the event a \"god\" is destroyed, the Avvar begin a year-long time of offerings and prayers and rituals I have no interest in knowing about further. At the end of this period, a new spirit takes on the name and role of the old one. I attempted to explain that this was not a \"god,\" merely a spirit drawn in by their desires. The Avvar mage declared, with a ridiculous air of superiority, that that was the {i}point{/i}.\n"

"This is a precise copy. The preceding pages were lost—or removed—ages ago. Bescond makes no further references to this woman, although Ameridan comes up several times later on. Bescond's writings, as they pertain to Inquisitor Ameridan, are not entirely unknown, although you're unlikely to find them among Chantry records. Their validity is largely dismissed. Some have questioned whether the so-called \"light\" and \"counsel\" reference magic or holy insight. And of course, Bescond wrote down his impressions many years after the fact. The author's own wife brought accuracy into question when she admitted her husband was recalling his youth in the Orlesian capital through nostalgia and age-distorted memory. I believe her admission is part of official Chantry record.\n"

"In a hold past our own, there were two men. One was born Ivatt Jovsen, the other Rekkas Hildsen. When word came lowlanders marched on Ivatt's hold, he searched for them. He found the lowlanders in a valley, and his heart was grieved, for they wore mail, and spoke eagerly of battling Avvar, and came in great numbers. But clever Ivatt studied the rock above the lowlanders. When they camped for the night, he climbed up to the tallest peak, and rolled a great boulder to the edge, aiming for the light of their fires. The boulder slid with other rocks into a mighty wave of dirt and stone. More than half their number were crushed, and the others fled in terror back to the lowlands.\n"
"\n"
"Ivatt's hold held a great feast to celebrate and said the songs would now call him Ivatt Stone-Thunder. Rekkas Hildsen grew jealous. Did he not shoot better than Ivatt? Did he not run faster than Ivatt? A great monster lived at the top of the mountain by the hold. It had feathers of gold, and taloned claws, and stole their game from the valley. Rekkas swore he would kill the beast to make his own legend-mark and went hunting on the mountain. \n"
"\n"
"The first night, Rekkas found and killed a ram. The second night, Rekkas found and killed a hart. The third night, Rekkas found the nest of the feathered monster, and it was empty. The hunter laid the hart and the ram on the nest, then climbed above it. When dawn broke, the monster returned. It greedily tore open the meat. While it was distracted, Rekkas leapt down and plunged his sword into its back.\n"
"\n"
"The monster screamed, but its hide was thick, and the sword stuck. The beast took off into the sky with the terrified Rekkas still on its back. The monster twisted and looped to shake him off, and the sword dropped into the deep valley. Desperate, Rekkas held on to the feathers on the monster's neck. He saw the beast would soon fly over his home, where all his friends and kin were gathered in astonishment at the sight above them. Rekkas threw his weight, trying to force the monster closer to the ground. It worked, and when the beast soared over the hold, Rekkas twisted and threw himself off. The gods were kind, and as the beast flew off, Rekkas landed on a midden heap, torn feathers floating about him. \n"
"\n"
"Rekkas was humble the rest of his days, never again letting jealousy take his head. The hunter knew, in the end, his legend-mark could have been far worse than \"Rekkas Feather-Fall.\"\n"

Korth, being a good sport, gave Sindri a hero's welcome, and the mortal returned to the Frostbacks with tales of the feasts of gods and gifts from Korth, and soon more and more heroes were barging into the hall of the Mountain-Father demanding to be showered with honors.

"While we still have little information on their methods, our agents have obtained considerable information on Ben-Hassrath hierarchy and organizational structure. Strictly speaking, the entire group is under the jurisdiction of the Ariqun and would therefore be considered priests. The Qunari divide all Ben-Hassrath activities into three distinct categories: \"Dangerous Purpose,\" \"Dangerous Action,\" and \"Dangerous Questions.\" Three priests form a mini-triumvirate that manages all their operations, with each priest presiding over actions in a single category. We have an ongoing mission to identify the leader of the \"Dangerous Questions\" branch, which seems to handle the vast majority of the Qunari intelligence gathering and sabotage missions. \"Dangerous Actions\" appears to be the branch responsible for enforcement; their agents almost never leave Qunari-controlled territory except to hunt defectors. The branch we have had the most contact with has been \"Dangerous Purpose.\"\n"

"Our attempts to infiltrate the Qunari \"reeducation\" camps have largely proven unsuccessful.

"The sun is shining, the sea birds are screeching, and almost nothing in Hightown has fallen into a sinkhole and ended up in the sewers in over a month. The red lyrium cleanup in the Gallows is going better than expected. Nobody misses having Meredith fused to the flagstones, eerily glaring at everyone. The city guard celebrated finally getting her out of there by holding a completely impromptu parade. Several Lowtown residents composed a song on the spot with lyrics to the effect of \"Thank the Maker the crazy cursed templar is gone,\" which was remarkably catchy—despite, or maybe because of, the fact that it was mostly just swearing in tune.\n"

"Even with all this stellar progress, it looks like I'm stuck here.

"\n"
"The quays at midnight exchange the cacophony of swearing sailors for the mournful sound of distant bells in the harbor. Donnen found Wagner and his two thugs waiting just out of sight of the harbormaster's office. In the fog, Wagner's white samite coat made him gleam like a smug moon.\n"
"\n"
"\"Messere Brennokovic. I trust you've brought my merchandise?\" Wagner smiled. Beside him, the tattooed Chasind cleaned what might have been blood from his nails with his dagger.\n"
"\n"
"Donnen reached into his coat and pulled out a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. \"We should discuss a few things first.\"\n"
"\n"
"Wagner's eyes gleamed in the reflected light of his paunch. \"The price, of course.\" He gestured to the scarred Ander, who held up a bag of coins. \"One hundred crowns should suffice, yes?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"That depends.\" Donnen toyed with the twine securing the bundle's wrapping. \"You killed Magistrate Dunwald, didn't you? After my run-in with your friends here, I realized the only blade that could have made that kind of stab wound was your Chasind's stone knife.\"\n"
"\n"
"Wagner shrugged. \"Men die all the time, serah. We should not let that unpleasantness get in the way of business.\" Another gesture, and the Ander strode forward to stand just inches away from Donnen, brandishing the bag of gold like a flail.\n"
"\n"
"\"And Jevlan?\" Donnen asked.\n"
"\n"
"\"I know nothing of your partner's fate.\"\n"

"Both Chasind and Ander drew their daggers.\n"

Because of this, the Qunari name them saarebas, meaning “dangerous thing,” and treat them with the utmost caution.

The evil is not the mage, but the loss of the mage, the loss of the mage’s self, and the suffering that inevitably follows.\n"

"The late Magistrate Dunwald's butler blinked as Donnen Brennokovic barged into the foyer.\n"
"\n"
"\"Get Lady Marielle. Now.\" He headed straight to the parlor where the magistrate's collection was displayed.\n"
"\n"
"Wrapped in a black shawl, Marielle sauntered into the room and leaned against one of the glass cases. \"Guardsman! What a pleasant surprise.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Where's Jevlan?\"\n"
"\n"
"Her smile faltered. \"Why do you think I would know? He's {i}your{/i} partner.\"\n"
"\n"
"Donnen held up the note. \"Your perfume, Lady Marielle.\" He dropped it on the display case beside her. \"What were you doing in the guard barracks?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I didn't leave the note,\" she said with measured calm. \"And I don't have your partner.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"But you {i}were{/i} in the barracks.\" He stepped away to examine a display. \"You told me Wagner wanted to buy the magistrate's entire collection, but he said he was only interested in one blade.\" He opened the case. \"And I think it was never in Seamus' collection. I think it was the sword meant to go right here.\" He pointed to the empty velvet-lined box. \"I looked in the viscount's records, and you've only been married to Magistrate Dunwald for about three weeks. You tell me who you're working for and where my partner is, and I'll see if we can't get you a deal with the viscount's office.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The Chantry.\" Marielle closed the door quietly. \"They sent me to Kirkwall a few months ago when rumors of the sword began to surface.\" She examined the note. \"I don't have Jevlan. This was already on his bunk when I went to find both of you.\"\n"
"\n"
"Donnen didn't hide his skepticism. \"You're innocent, but you didn't report him missing to any of the guards.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Someone took him from the barracks, serah, with no one the wiser. That doesn't seem strange to you?\" She looked him in the eye. \"Have you ever heard of the Executors?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"They're a myth.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"A myth that kills.\" She sighed. \"The Executors have your partner, and I think they have someone inside the city guard. How else could they have gotten Jevlan out of the keep without being seen?\"\n"
"\n"
"Donnen watched her fidget with her shawl. \"Why were you in the barracks?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"I suspected the Executors had an inside man.\" She shrugged. \"How else could they have gotten poor Comte de Favre to open the door to his killer? Since he arranged the sword's purchase for Seamus, he'd been hiding in his own home. The only people he'd seen were Seamus and you.\""

"Grand Enchanter Lothaire Hardouin was the first leader of the Circle of Magi when it was founded in 1:20 Divine. After Hardouin distinguished himself in battle during the Second Blight, Emperor Drakon himself endorsed him for the position. From all accounts, the Grand Enchanter performed admirably, but some speculate Hardouin was a second choice—that Drakon had another mage, with connections to Inquisitor Ameridan, in mind for the job.\n"
"\n"
"Tellingly, these debates are based on a half-finished letter to an army captain and the guest list of a party where Ameridan and the emperor were in attendance. If any proof ever existed, it is likely dust. The idea's merits should be treated as such, for scholarship's sake.\n"

"Forgive the absence of my letters. The Dalish raids were ominous enough, but now Gaspard's chevaliers ride through my estates without so much as a by-your-leave! What a time to rattle their swords: a shipment came the other day with things that will not travel well. A rare Nevarran miniature of Andraste, a triptych lattice of thinnest oak from Tevinter, and, most wondrous of all—a pre-Chantry full-length elven mirror! \n"

I purchased the entire lot—there were some other minor artifacts and trinkets—and the mirror has quickly become my favorite.

I will send for the mirror when I am safely in Val Royeaux, then throw a party where you can marvel at it yourself!\n"

"Beast presents chafing around limbs and tail, likely from attempts to use chains. While its natural strength remains, muscles are slack from confinement.

It is likely that some view elves with suspicion, thanks to these attacks by the agent of Fen'Harel, but a human woman may still pass unnoticed among the servants.

"\n"
"\"Give me the sword! I know that pirate hag gave it to you!\" Jevlan swung a series of hard slashes, trying to break Donnen's guard or knock him down the stairs. In the darkness and the driving rain, the guardsman struggled to see his attacker.\n"

"Still, Donnen grinned. \"You left it at the quay. I guess you ran off without it when the lady took your hand off. Not my fault you picked a fight you couldn't win.\" He tried to edge away from the stairs, but the rookie kept him pinned between the vegetable stall and a fall to his death.\n"
"\n"
"Jevlan lunged, his blade punching through Donnen's armor just below his ribs, but the recruit slipped on the wet stone during his attack and stumbled into his enemy. Donnen shoved him away—and over the stairs. His fall ended with a sickening crack of broken bones.\n"

The fog drifted off to haunt a better part of the Wounded Coast, and as Donnen reached the chantry courtyard, the clouds parted to let a sliver of moonlight shine on the rain-swept flagstones. He stopped to catch his breath and tighten the torn-off coat sleeve he'd used as a bandage. The bleeding was slowing, which meant either the wound in his side wasn't that deep or he was running out of blood to lose. Trying not to dwell on the latter, he pushed open the chantry doors.\n"

"They say you can buy anything in the Lowtown Bazaar. It's mostly true. On the right day, you can find vendors hawking spices from Seheron, the legacies of unknown dwarven Paragons, maps to hidden fortresses in the Donarks, and the crown jewels of Antiva. And no bookstore in Thedas peddles more wild stories than Lowtown.\n"
"\n"
"Donnen Brennokovic made a point of greeting each shopkeeper as he passed so that the continual chant of \"Guardsman\" reached the ears of the two large men shadowing him since he'd left Lady Marielle in Hightown.\n"
"\n"
"The address she'd given him led to a warehouse in the Foundry district, a section of the city populated only by rusted metal spikes and vagrants. Donnen knocked on the door.\n"
"\n"
"An immaculately dressed butler greeted him and gestured for him to enter. \"Guardsman Brennokovic. Messere Wagner has been expecting you.\"\n"
"\n"
"Donnen followed him through a labyrinth of warehouse offices to a back room richly appointed with silk carpets and tapestries depicting the execution of Andraste. Two heavy armchairs upholstered in velvet occupied the center of the room. In one sat a smug red-haired man dressed entirely in blinding white samite. The other chair was empty.\n"
"\n"
"\"Guardsman! Please, sit.\" The gentleman spoke with a heavy Starkhaven accent.\n"
"\n"
"\"I suppose you would be Messere Wagner?\" Donnen asked.\n"
"\n"
"\"I am a procurer of antiquities, Serah Brennokovic. As I'm sure the Lady Dunwald explained.\" Wagner carefully lit a pipe made of carved bloodstone and inhaled. \"But we are both men of business, guardsman. You are soon to retire, are you not? Allow me to present you with an opportunity.\"\n"
"\n"
"Donnen turned a critical eye on the tapestry of Andraste's pyre. \"I'm listening.\"\n"
"\n"
"Wagner watched him through a growing veil of smoke. \"Do you know what Seamus Dunwald had in his possession, guardsman? What made the poor man worth killing?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Do tell.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The Sword of Hessarian.\" Wagner leaned forward, studying him closely. \"The very blade that pierced Andraste's heart.\"\n"
"\n"
"Donnen gave him a flat stare. \"If I believed that were even possible, I'd think that blade would be worth a lot of coin.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"Most would look at it and see a rusted piece of scrap. It is no longer the jeweled blade of an archon. But to the right buyer, guardsman, the sword is worth an empire's ransom. I know such buyers.\" Wagner smiled. \"It is here. In Kirkwall. And if you help me find it, I can make you a very rich man.\""

"Donnen Brennokovic had been pursuing the killer of Magistrate Dunwald without food or rest, and so far all he had was the seal of an imaginary group, a wounded arm, and a package that contained a rusted Tevinter shortsword. He was past exhaustion, and every breath made his head throb like he'd had too much to drink. He was getting too old for this shit.\n"

We are {i}caretakers{/i} of the Memories and the dwarven people. We write down every birth, every death, and every great deed. The events we record and preserve are the last links we have to the empire of old, when our kingdom knew no limits but the surface. Our holdings are now small, barely a shadow of what they once were. This is why the knowledge in the Memories must not be lost.\n"

The Mining Caste listens for isana's song to tap into the Stone's precious gifts. But the wisdom that the Memories whisper to a Shaper cannot be measured in coin. Dwarves are the children of the Stone. The best of us strengthen her. The worst are forgotten. The Shaperate listens and tends to the Stone so that future generations may prove worthy of her embrace.\n"

"Mining lyrium is not work for the fainthearted. The stuff is dangerous to handle safely and difficult to find, and its veins only ever seem to run through the hardest rock. Lyrium is nothing but trouble, but luckily it offers a solution to its own problem. Pack the right amount into a small drum, prime it with a short fuse, light the thing, and run as fast as you can. The blast will leave your ears ringing for days after, but it will also explode any number of obstacles. There's a saying among long-time lyrium miners: \"When the going gets tough, the tough get out a blast charge and blow a great sodding hole in the stone.\"\n"

"Kings cannot choose their legacy, only steer the tide of public opinion and hope that history is kind. It so rarely is. As the youngest child of King Endrin Aeducan, Prince Bhelen was never meant to rule. That honor belonged to Trian, eldest heir to House Aeducan. Trian's murder fractured Orzammar's once-stable foundations and created a sickness within the noble walls of the palace—one that drove Endrin to his death. In the wake of this tragedy, Bhelen pushed aside his own grief to claim a throne for which he never asked—all to stop a wraith-blooded ally who saw the king's death as an opportunity to rise above his station. Indeed, if not for the Hero of Ferelden, House Aeducan may have become a thing for the Memories. Since taking the throne, King Bhelen has made it clear that his greatest concern is the future of the dwarven people. Will our king be remembered for his tolerance? For his progressive thinking? Or perhaps Bhelen Aeducan's reign will be forever overshadowed by his rocky ascension to the throne, as the unlikely prince who became king.\n"

On the tip of each flame hung the corpses of those we'd lost—including Father and Drohg. They'd been drained of blood, leaving only bone wrapped in thin grey skin. A robed Scaled One stood before the altar. Its voice was different from the others: softer, almost feminine. It chanted and raised a basin of blood toward the altar. The other Scaled Ones bowed low. The robed Scaled One produced fire from its palm and mouth and ignited the blood. \n"

"Othon grabbed my forearm and motioned for us to climb down. We returned to the rest of the company, where he relayed what we had witnessed. We would rest for an hour, regain our strength, and strike. \n"
"\n"
"The memory of Father's sagging, emptied face kept me awake. The hour passed slowly, but it did pass. Othon led us down the path to the overlook. I readied my axe for blood and steeled myself for the sight of the altar. But it wasn't there. The camp, Father and Drohg, the Scaled Ones... all gone. Only the basin remained, charred around the edges.\n"

"What I remember most is its tongue flapping against a row of spiky teeth. I'd heard emissaries possessed the ability to speak, but the words were unnatural. They twisted and lurched as they left the creature's mouth, accompanied with a spray of saliva. \n"

"My ankle was broken from the battle, but I dragged myself away. The pain I felt would be nothing compared to what the emissary would do to me. Rycus stayed behind. I never knew if he was covering my escape, trying to save Mila, or had simply given up. I sensed a surge of dark magic, then heard his cry and a thud. I didn't look back, just crawled as fast as I could. When I reached the surface, the back of my boots were splattered with blood.\n"

"In a time that only the Stone remembers, there was a thaig in the deepest caverns ruled by a wise old king. The riches in the Stone had provided well for the thaig: lyrium flowed like water from the ground, gold and jewels sprouted from the walls like mushrooms, and the people wanted for nothing.\n"
"\n"
"One day, the king returned to the Stone and left behind two sons to vie for his throne. Neither had been named heir, and so each sought to prove to their father's Assembly that he was best suited to be king.\n"
"\n"
"The first son journeyed far and wide across the Deep Roads, forging alliances with the other thaigs, and returned home bearing word of the goodwill of distant kingdoms and their promises of future friendship. But the Assembly was not impressed with words and promises and would not name him heir.\n"
"\n"
"So the second son mined the ground for wealth. Every last scrap of lyrium, every nugget of gold he dug up and gifted to the thaig. But the Assembly, accustomed to abundance, was not impressed. So the second son dug farther and farther into the Stone—so far that he broke through to the other side and found the sky. And this he claimed for his thaig. And the Assembly named him king.\n"
"\n"
"But the Assembly wanted him to bring back his treasure for the thaig. The new king climbed down and down the endless mine until he reached the sky, but try as he might, he could not pull the sky up, nor strike it to pieces with his pickaxe. The new king mined out more and more earth, trying to carve a path to the sky, and finally, he undermined his thaig so much that the whole kingdom broke loose and fell far, far into the ground and up into the sky\n"
